# Module 09 Quiz: Inheritance — Answer Key

---

## Part A: Multiple Choice (7 points)

| Q# | Answer | Explanation |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | B | Heterozygous = two different alleles |
| 2 | B | Phenotype = physical appearance |
| 3 | A | 1 in 4 (aa) shows recessive phenotype |
| 4 | B | Pink intermediate = incomplete dominance |
| 5 | C | X-linked recessive more common in males |
| 6 | C | AB blood = codominance (both expressed) |
| 7 | B | Filled circle = affected female |

## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. BB × bb Cross (1 point)**
- All offspring will have genotype **Bb** (100% heterozygous)
- All offspring will show the **dominant phenotype**
- Punnett square:
  - B × b = Bb, B × b = Bb, B × b = Bb, B × b = Bb
- 100% heterozygous, 100% dominant phenotype

**9. Color Blindness in Males (1 point)**
- Color blindness is X-linked recessive
- Males have only one X chromosome (XY)
- One copy of the recessive allele causes the condition in males
- Females need two copies (one on each X) to be affected
- Females with one copy are carriers but not affected

**10. Genotype vs. Phenotype (1 point)**
- **Genotype**: The genetic makeup/alleles (e.g., Bb for a trait)
- **Phenotype**: The observable physical trait (e.g., brown eyes)
- Example: A person with genotype Bb for eye color might have the brown eye phenotype if B is dominant
- Multiple genotypes (BB and Bb) can produce the same phenotype
