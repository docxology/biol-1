# Module 12 Quiz: Muscular System — Answer Key

---

## Part A: Multiple Choice (7 points)

| Q# | Answer | Explanation |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | C | Sarcomere is the functional unit |
| 2 | B | Myosin = thick filaments |
| 3 | C | Acetylcholine at NMJ |
| 4 | C | Calcium triggers contraction |
| 5 | B | Filaments slide, don't shorten |
| 6 | B | Slow-twitch = endurance |
| 7 | B | Motor unit = neuron + all its fibers |

## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Sliding Filament Theory (1 point)**
- Calcium is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum
- Calcium binds to troponin, exposing actin binding sites
- Myosin heads bind to actin forming cross-bridges
- ATP hydrolysis powers the power stroke, pulling actin toward center
- Sarcomere shortens as thin filaments slide over thick filaments
- Cycle repeats as long as calcium and ATP are present

**9. ATP in Muscle Contraction (1 point)**
- ATP binds to myosin head causing it to release from actin
- ATP hydrolysis cocks the myosin head for the next power stroke
- ATP is needed to pump calcium back into sarcoplasmic reticulum (relaxation)
- Without ATP, muscles cannot contract or relax (rigor mortis)

**10. Muscle Fiber Types (1 point)**
| Feature | Slow-Twitch (Type I) | Fast-Twitch (Type II) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Contraction speed | Slow | Fast |
| Fatigue resistance | High | Low |
| Myoglobin content | High (red) | Low (white) |
| Mitochondria | Many | Few |
| Best for | Endurance | Power/speed |
| Example activities | Marathon | Sprinting |
