## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Pathogen Types Comparison (1 point)**
- **Bacteria**: Prokaryotic single cells; can be treated with antibiotics
- **Viruses**: Not living; require host cells to replicate; not killed by antibiotics
- **Fungi**: Eukaryotic; include yeasts and molds; cause skin/systemic infections
- **Parasites**: Protozoa (single-celled) or helminths (worms); live in/on host
- **Prions**: Misfolded proteins; cause brain diseases; no treatment available

**9. Antibiotics vs. Viruses (1 point)**
- Antibiotics target bacterial structures (cell walls, ribosomes, enzymes)
- Viruses lack these structures; they use host cell machinery
- Viruses are inside host cells, protected from antibiotics
- Antiviral drugs target viral enzymes, but antibiotics cannot
- Prevention with vaccines is more effective for viral diseases

**10. Inflammatory Response (1 point)**
- Local response to infection or injury
- Blood vessels dilate (vasodilation) → redness and heat
- Capillaries become more permeable → swelling (edema)
- White blood cells (phagocytes) migrate to area
- Purpose: isolate, contain, and destroy pathogens; promote healing
- Signs: redness, heat, swelling, pain
