# Module 14 Quiz: Cardiovascular System — Answer Key

---

## Part A: Multiple Choice (7 points)

| Q# | Answer | Explanation |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | B | Deoxygenated blood enters right atrium |
| 2 | B | SA node is the pacemaker |
| 3 | C | Arteries carry blood away from heart |
| 4 | C | Capillaries are gas exchange sites |
| 5 | B | "Lub" = AV valves closing |
| 6 | B | Valves prevent backflow |
| 7 | B | Systolic = ventricular contraction |

## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Blood Flow Through Heart (1 point)**
- Right atrium → Tricuspid valve → Right ventricle
- Right ventricle → Pulmonary semilunar valve → Pulmonary arteries → Lungs
- Lungs → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium
- Left atrium → Bicuspid (mitral) valve → Left ventricle
- Left ventricle → Aortic semilunar valve → Aorta → Body

**9. Blood Vessel Comparison (1 point)**
| Vessel | Structure | Function |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Arteries | Thick walls, elastic, muscular | Carry oxygenated blood away from heart; handle high pressure |
| Veins | Thinner walls, have valves | Carry deoxygenated blood to heart; low pressure |
| Capillaries | One cell thick | Gas and nutrient exchange with tissues |

**10. SA Node Function (1 point)**
- SA node is located in the right atrium
- It generates electrical impulses automatically (~60-100 times/min)
- Impulses spread through atria, causing atrial contraction
- Signal reaches AV node, which delays briefly, then sends to ventricles
- SA node sets the pace for the entire heart rhythm
- Autonomic nervous system can speed up or slow down the SA node
