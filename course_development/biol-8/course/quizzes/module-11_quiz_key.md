## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Bone Cell Types (1 point)**
- **Osteoblasts**: Bone-forming cells; secrete bone matrix; become osteocytes when surrounded
- **Osteocytes**: Mature bone cells; maintain bone tissue; sense mechanical stress
- **Osteoclasts**: Bone-resorbing cells; break down bone matrix; important for remodeling

**9. Compact vs. Spongy Bone (1 point)**
- **Compact bone**: Dense, solid structure; organized into osteons; found in shaft of long bones; provides strength
- **Spongy bone**: Porous, trabecular structure; lighter weight; found at ends of long bones; contains red marrow
- Both work together to provide strength while minimizing weight

**10. Osteoporosis (1 point)**
- Osteoporosis is a condition of decreased bone density and increased fracture risk
- Risk factors include:
  - Age (especially postmenopausal women)
  - Low calcium/vitamin D intake
  - Lack of weight-bearing exercise
  - Smoking and excessive alcohol
  - Family history
  - Hormonal changes (decreased estrogen)
