## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Four Tissue Types (1 point)**
- **Epithelial**: Covers surfaces, lines cavities; protection, secretion, absorption
- **Connective**: Connects and supports; includes bone, cartilage, blood, fat
- **Muscle**: Produces movement; skeletal, cardiac, smooth
- **Nervous**: Transmits signals; neurons and supporting glial cells

**9. Muscle Type Comparison (1 point)**
| Feature | Skeletal | Cardiac | Smooth |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| Appearance | Striated | Striated | Non-striated |
| Control | Voluntary | Involuntary | Involuntary |
| Location | Attached to bones | Heart | Organs, vessels |
| Nuclei | Multinucleated | Single, central | Single, central |

**10. Epithelium in Digestive Tract (1 point)**
- Provides initial barrier against pathogens and physical damage
- Columnar cells in intestines have microvilli for absorption
- Contains goblet cells that secrete protective mucus
- Rapidly divides to replace worn cells (high turnover)
- Selectively permeable to allow nutrient absorption
