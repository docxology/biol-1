## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Covalent vs. Ionic Bond (1 point)**
- **Covalent bond**: Atoms share electrons to fill their outer shells
- **Ionic bond**: One atom transfers electrons to another; creates charged ions that attract
- Covalent bonds typically form between nonmetals; ionic bonds between metals and nonmetals

**9. Properties of Water (1 point)**
Full credit for any two with explanations:
- **High specific heat**: Water resists temperature changes, helping organisms maintain stable body temperature
- **Cohesion**: Water molecules stick together, enabling water transport in plants
- **Solvent properties**: Water dissolves many substances, allowing transport of nutrients in blood
- **Lower density as ice**: Ice floats, insulating bodies of water and allowing life to survive winter
- **High heat of vaporization**: Sweating cools the body efficiently

**10. pH and Body Functions (1 point)**
- pH 6.8 is more acidic than normal (7.4)
- Enzymes are pH-sensitive and may denature or not function properly
- Metabolic processes would be disrupted
- Acidosis can affect nerve function, muscle contraction, and organ function
- Buffers normally maintain pH; severe imbalances can be life-threatening
