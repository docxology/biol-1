## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Enzymes and Activation Energy (1 point)**
- Activation energy is the energy needed to start a chemical reaction
- Enzymes lower activation energy by stabilizing the transition state
- This allows reactions to occur faster at body temperature
- Without enzymes, most cellular reactions would be too slow to sustain life

**9. ATP Yield Comparison (1 point)**
- Aerobic respiration produces ~36-38 ATP per glucose molecule
- Fermentation produces only 2 ATP per glucose molecule
- Fermentation is less efficient because it doesn't use the electron transport chain
- Most energy remains in the fermentation products (lactic acid or ethanol)

**10. Muscle Cells During Intense Exercise (1 point)**
- Oxygen delivery cannot keep up with ATP demand
- Cells switch from aerobic respiration to lactic acid fermentation
- Pyruvate is converted to lactic acid
- This produces less ATP but allows glycolysis to continue
- Lactic acid accumulation contributes to muscle fatigue and burning sensation
