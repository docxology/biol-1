## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Dehydration Synthesis vs. Hydrolysis (1 point)**
- **Dehydration synthesis**: Joins monomers by removing a water molecule; used to build polymers (building proteins, starch, etc.)
- **Hydrolysis**: Breaks polymers by adding a water molecule; used in digestion to break down food
- They are opposite reactions

**9. Carbohydrate Comparison (1 point)**
- **Monosaccharides**: Single sugars (glucose, fructose); quick energy source
- **Disaccharides**: Two sugars joined (sucrose, lactose); must be broken down for use
- **Polysaccharides**: Many sugars joined (starch, glycogen, cellulose); energy storage (starch, glycogen) or structural support (cellulose)

**10. Protein Shape and Function (1 point)**
- Protein shape creates specific active sites for binding substrates
- Function depends on precise 3D structure (lock and key)
- **Denaturation** (loss of shape) can be caused by:
  - High temperature
  - Extreme pH
  - Chemicals
- Denatured proteins cannot function properly
