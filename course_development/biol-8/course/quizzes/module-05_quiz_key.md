# Module 05 Quiz: Membranes — Answer Key

---

## Part A: Multiple Choice (7 points)

| Q# | Answer | Explanation |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | B | Fluid mosaic model describes membrane structure |
| 2 | C | Passive transport requires no energy |
| 3 | B | Pure water is hypotonic; cell will swell |
| 4 | B | Osmosis = water movement across membrane |
| 5 | B | Facilitated diffusion uses proteins but no ATP |
| 6 | B | Na+ out, K+ in (against gradients, uses ATP) |
| 7 | B | Hypertonic = water leaves cell, shrinkage |

## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Selective Permeability (1 point)**
- Membrane allows some substances to pass while blocking others
- Small, nonpolar molecules pass easily through lipid bilayer
- Large, polar, or charged molecules need transport proteins
- This control maintains proper internal environment (homeostasis)

**9. Passive vs. Active Transport (1 point)**
- **Passive transport**: No energy required; moves substances down concentration gradient
  - Examples: diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion
- **Active transport**: Requires ATP; moves substances against concentration gradient
  - Examples: sodium-potassium pump, endocytosis, exocytosis
- Active transport can move molecules from low to high concentration

**10. Isotonic IV Fluids (1 point)**
- Isotonic solution has same solute concentration as blood
- If hypotonic: water would enter blood cells, causing swelling/lysis
- If hypertonic: water would leave blood cells, causing shrinkage (crenation)
- Isotonic solution protects blood cells and maintains proper function
