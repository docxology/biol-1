## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Hypothesis Definition (1 point)**
- A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for an observation
- Must be testable through experimentation
- Example: "If fertilizer is added to plants, then they will grow taller"
- If not testable, it cannot be scientifically evaluated

**9. Three Characteristics of Living Things (1 point)**
Full credit for any three of the following with brief explanations:
- **Cellular organization**: All living things are made of one or more cells
- **Metabolism**: Living things carry out chemical reactions to obtain energy
- **Homeostasis**: Organisms maintain stable internal conditions
- **Growth and development**: Living things grow and change over time
- **Reproduction**: Living things produce offspring
- **Response to stimuli**: Organisms react to changes in their environment
- **Adaptation/Evolution**: Populations change over generations

**10. Control vs. Experimental Group (1 point)**
- **Control group**: Does not receive the experimental treatment; serves as a baseline for comparison
- **Experimental group**: Receives the treatment or variable being tested
- Comparing the two groups allows scientists to determine if the treatment had an effect
