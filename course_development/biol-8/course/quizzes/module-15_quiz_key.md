## Part A: Multiple Choice (7 points)

| Q# | Answer | Explanation |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | C | Alveoli are gas exchange sites |
| 2 | B | Diaphragm contracts during inhalation |
| 3 | C | Hemoglobin carries oxygen |
| 4 | B | CO₂ is primary breathing stimulus |
| 5 | B | Surfactant reduces surface tension |
| 6 | B | External resp = alveolar gas exchange |
| 7 | C | Epiglottis covers trachea when swallowing |

## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Mechanics of Inhalation (1 point)**
- Diaphragm contracts and flattens (moves down)
- External intercostal muscles contract, lifting the ribs
- Thoracic cavity volume increases
- Pressure inside lungs decreases (below atmospheric pressure)
- Air rushes into lungs to equalize pressure
- Result: air flows into alveoli

**9. Oxygen and CO₂ Transport (1 point)**
- **Oxygen**: ~98% bound to hemoglobin in RBCs (as oxyhemoglobin); ~2% dissolved in plasma
- **Carbon dioxide**: ~70% as bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻); ~23% bound to hemoglobin (as carbaminohemoglobin); ~7% dissolved in plasma
- O₂ loading occurs in lungs; unloading in tissues
- CO₂ loading occurs in tissues; unloading in lungs

**10. Breathing Regulation (1 point)**
- Respiratory control center in medulla oblongata sets breathing rhythm
- Chemoreceptors (in medulla and aortic/carotid bodies) detect CO₂ and O₂ levels
- When CO₂ increases:
  - Blood pH decreases (more acidic)
  - Chemoreceptors stimulate medulla
  - Breathing rate and depth increase
  - More CO₂ is exhaled, restoring balance
- Feedback mechanism maintains homeostasis
