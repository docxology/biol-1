## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells (1 point)**
- **Prokaryotic**: No membrane-bound nucleus or organelles; DNA in nucleoid region; smaller; example: bacteria
- **Eukaryotic**: Has membrane-bound nucleus and organelles; larger; examples: plants, animals, fungi, protists

**9. Protein Secretion Pathway (1 point)**
- Synthesized on **ribosomes** attached to **rough ER**
- Transported in vesicles to **Golgi apparatus** for modification and packaging
- Golgi releases vesicles that fuse with **plasma membrane** (exocytosis)
- Protein secreted outside the cell

**10. Endosymbiotic Theory (1 point)**
- Theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes
- They were engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells and became organelles
- Evidence includes:
  - They have their own DNA (circular, like bacteria)
  - They have their own ribosomes (similar to bacterial ribosomes)
  - They divide independently by binary fission
  - Double membrane (outer from engulfing cell)
