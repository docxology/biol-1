## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Mitosis vs. Meiosis (1 point)**
- **Mitosis**: Produces 2 genetically identical diploid cells; purpose is growth and repair
- **Meiosis**: Produces 4 genetically unique haploid cells; purpose is sexual reproduction
- Mitosis has one division; meiosis has two divisions
- Mitosis maintains chromosome number; meiosis reduces it by half

**9. Genetic Variation Mechanisms (1 point)**
- **Crossing over**: Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes creates new allele combinations
- **Independent assortment**: Random orientation of homologs at metaphase I creates 2²³ possible combinations (in humans)
- Together, these ensure each gamete is genetically unique
- Random fertilization further increases variation

**10. Nondisjunction (1 point)**
- Nondisjunction is the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis
- Results in gametes with abnormal chromosome numbers (too many or too few)
- Example condition: **Down syndrome** (trisomy 21) - three copies of chromosome 21
- Other examples: Turner syndrome (monosomy X), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)
