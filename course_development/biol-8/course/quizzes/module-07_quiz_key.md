## Part B: Free Response (3 points)

**8. Prophase Events (1 point)**
- Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes
- Nuclear envelope begins to break down
- Nucleolus disappears
- Centrosomes move to opposite poles
- Mitotic spindle begins to form

**9. Importance of Mitosis (1 point)**
- Produces genetically identical cells for growth (increasing cell number)
- Replaces damaged or worn-out cells (repair)
- Allows organisms to develop from a single fertilized egg
- Ensures each new cell has a complete copy of DNA

**10. Cell Cycle Regulation and Cancer (1 point)**
- Checkpoints normally prevent damaged cells from dividing
- Mutations in genes controlling checkpoints can allow uncontrolled division
- Cells may divide without proper DNA repair or growth signals
- Result is a mass of abnormal cells (tumor)
- Cancer cells can invade other tissues (metastasis) if not controlled
