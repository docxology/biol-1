## Part A: Multiple Choice (50 points)

| Q# | Answer | Explanation |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | D | Meiosis produces four haploid cells (gametes) |
| 2 | A | Crossing over occurs during prophase I when homologs pair |
| 3 | A | Independent assortment: random homolog orientation at metaphase I |
| 4 | B | Nondisjunction causes aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number) |
| 5 | C | Diploid (46) → after meiosis I (23) → after meiosis II (23 in each) |
| 6 | B | Aa × Aa = 1AA:2Aa:1aa phenotypic ratio 3:1 |
| 7 | B | 1/4 (25%) will be aa |
| 8 | B | Incomplete dominance: intermediate heterozygote phenotype |
| 9 | C | Half of sons receive X^c from carrier mother |
| 10 | C | ABO blood type: multiple alleles (I^A, I^B, i) and codominance (I^A I^B) |
| 11 | C | Muscle tissue specializes in contraction |
| 12 | C | Simple squamous = thin, good for diffusion/filtration |
| 13 | C | Blood has liquid matrix (plasma) |
| 14 | D | Neurons are the cells of nervous tissue |
| 15 | B | Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth are the three muscle types |
| 16 | C | Bones don't produce hormones (endocrine system does) |
| 17 | B | Osteons are the structural units of compact bone |
| 18 | C | Osteoclasts break down bone (resorption) |
| 19 | B | Epiphyseal plate = growth in length |
| 20 | C | Synovial joints are freely movable |
| 21 | B | Axial skeleton = skull, vertebrae, ribs |
| 22 | B | Osteoblasts build bone |
| 23 | B | Red marrow produces blood cells |
| 24 | B | Periosteum is the outer bone covering |
| 25 | B | Osteoporosis = decreased density, increased fracture risk |

## Part B: Short Answer (30 points)

**1. Mitosis vs. Meiosis**
- Mitosis: produces 2 diploid cells for growth/repair
- Meiosis: produces 4 haploid cells for reproduction
- Mitosis maintains chromosome number; meiosis reduces it by half
- Mitosis: one division; meiosis: two divisions

**2. Genetic Variation Mechanisms**
- Crossing over: exchanges segments between homologous chromosomes, creating new allele combinations
- Independent assortment: random orientation of homologs creates 2^23 possible combinations in humans
- Together they ensure each gamete is genetically unique

**3. Blood Type Problem**
- Father AO × Mother BO
- Punnett square: AB, AO, BO, OO
- Possible blood types: AB, A, B, O (each 25%)

**4. Muscle Tissue Comparison**
- Skeletal: striated, multinucleated, voluntary; long cylindrical fibers for powerful movement
- Cardiac: striated, single nucleus, involuntary; intercalated discs for coordinated contraction
- Smooth: non-striated, single nucleus, involuntary; spindle-shaped for slow sustained contractions

**5. Bone Remodeling**
- Continuous process of bone resorption (osteoclasts) and deposition (osteoblasts)
- Allows bones to adapt to stress, repair microdamage, and regulate calcium
- Important for maintaining bone strength and responding to changing mechanical demands

**6. Compact vs. Spongy Bone**
- Compact: dense, organized osteons, found in shaft of long bones; provides strength
- Spongy: porous trabeculae, found in ends of long bones; lightweight, contains red marrow
