## Part B: Short Answer (30 points)

**1. Sliding Filament Theory**
- Myosin heads bind to actin forming cross-bridges
- ATP hydrolysis powers the myosin head to pull actin toward center of sarcomere
- Repeated cycles cause thin filaments to slide over thick filaments
- Sarcomere shortens, but individual filaments don't change length

**2. Lytic vs. Lysogenic Cycle**
- Lytic: virus immediately replicates using host machinery, new viruses burst from cell
- Lysogenic: viral DNA integrates into host genome, remains dormant
- Lysogenic can later switch to lytic under certain conditions
- Both require host cell for replication

**3. Antibiotics vs. Viruses**
- Antibiotics target bacterial structures/processes (cell walls, ribosomes, enzymes)
- Viruses lack these structures; they use host cell machinery
- Antivirals target viral enzymes or prevent viral entry, but antibiotics cannot
- Prevention through vaccines is most effective for viruses

**4. Blood Path Through Heart**
- Right atrium → tricuspid valve → Right ventricle
- Right ventricle → pulmonary semilunar valve → Pulmonary arteries → Lungs
- Pulmonary veins → Left atrium → bicuspid (mitral) valve → Left ventricle
- Left ventricle → aortic semilunar valve → Aorta

**5. Mechanics of Breathing**
- Inspiration: diaphragm contracts/flattens, intercostals lift ribs, thoracic cavity expands
- Decreased pressure draws air in
- Expiration: diaphragm relaxes/domes up, elastic recoil decreases chest volume
- Increased pressure forces air out (passive during rest)

**6. Oxygen and CO2 Transport**
- Oxygen: ~98% bound to hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin), ~2% dissolved in plasma
- CO2: ~70% as bicarbonate ions, ~23% bound to hemoglobin, ~7% dissolved
- Hemoglobin releases O2 in tissues where CO2 is high
- In lungs, CO2 is released and O2 binds
