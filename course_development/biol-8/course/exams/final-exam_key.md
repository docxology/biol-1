## Part B: Short Answer (45 points)

**1. Photosynthesis vs. Cellular Respiration**
- Photosynthesis: CO2 + H2O + light → glucose + O2; captures energy
- Cellular respiration: glucose + O2 → CO2 + H2O + ATP; releases energy
- They are opposite processes that cycle matter and energy

**2. DNA Structure and Information Storage**
- Double helix with complementary base pairing (A-T, G-C)
- Sequence of bases encodes genetic information
- Complementary strands allow accurate replication

**3. Crossing Over**
- Occurs during prophase I when homologous chromosomes pair
- Segments of chromatids are exchanged between homologs
- Creates new combinations of alleles, increasing genetic variation

**4. Blood Vessel Comparison**
- Arteries: thick walls, elastic, carry blood away from heart
- Veins: thinner walls, have valves, carry blood to heart
- Capillaries: thin walls (one cell thick), allow exchange

**5. Alveoli Structure-Function**
- Thin walls (one cell thick) shorten diffusion distance
- Large surface area maximizes gas exchange
- Surrounded by capillaries for efficient blood-gas contact
- Surfactant prevents collapse

**6. Movement Systems Integration**
- Nervous system sends signals to muscles
- Muscles contract and pull on bones
- Skeletal system provides levers and points of attachment
- Joints allow movement in specific directions

**7. Vaccine Mechanism**
- Vaccines contain weakened/killed pathogens or their parts
- Immune system produces memory cells
- Future exposure triggers rapid, strong response
- Prevents disease before symptoms develop

**8. Muscle Tissue Comparison**
- Skeletal: striated, attached to bones, voluntary, movement
- Cardiac: striated, heart only, involuntary, pumping blood
- Smooth: non-striated, organs/vessels, involuntary, slow contraction

**9. Cell Cycle and Cancer**
- Interphase (G1, S, G2) prepares cell for division
- Mitosis divides the nucleus; cytokinesis divides cell
- Checkpoints prevent damaged cells from dividing
- Failed regulation leads to uncontrolled growth (cancer)
