## Part B: Short Answer (30 points)

**1. Hypothesis vs. Theory**
- A hypothesis is a tentative, testable explanation for an observation
- A theory is a well-tested, broadly accepted explanation supported by extensive evidence
- Theories are supported by many experiments; hypotheses are starting points for investigation

**2. Properties of Water**
- High specific heat allows organisms to maintain stable internal temperatures
- Cohesion (water sticking to itself) enables water transport in plants and surface tension
- Solvent properties allow water to dissolve nutrients, wastes, and other molecules for transport and reactions

**3. Carbohydrates vs. Lipids**
- Carbohydrates: C, H, O in 1:2:1 ratio; monosaccharide monomers; quick energy and structural roles
- Lipids: C, H, O but more H; not true polymers; long-term energy storage, membranes, hormones
- Carbs are hydrophilic; lipids are hydrophobic

**4. Selective Permeability**
- Phospholipid bilayer is hydrophobic in the middle, blocking polar/charged molecules
- Small nonpolar molecules can pass freely through the membrane
- Proteins provide channels and carriers for specific molecules that cannot cross on their own

**5. Enzymes and Temperature**
- Enzymes are biological catalysts that lower activation energy
- Each enzyme has an optimal temperature for maximum activity
- Too high temperatures denature enzymes by disrupting their 3D structure; too low temperatures slow molecular motion

**6. Cell Cycle Checkpoints**
- Checkpoints are control points where the cell verifies conditions before proceeding
- They check for DNA damage, proper chromosome attachment, and cell size
- Failure of checkpoints can lead to uncontrolled division (cancer)
