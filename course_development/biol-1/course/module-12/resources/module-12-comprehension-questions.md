# Module 12: Gene Expression (DNA to Protein)
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **DNA Structure**
    *   Describe the **Double Helix**. What forms the "backbone"? What forms the "rungs"?
    *   Explain **Antiparallel** orientation (5' to 3').
    *   State **Chargaff's Rule**. If a DNA sample is 20% Adenine, what % is Cytosine?

2.  **The Central Dogma**
    *   Draw the flow of information: **DNA -> RNA -> Protein**.
    *   Where does **Transcription** happen in a eukaryotic cell? Where does **Translation** happen?

3.  **The Machinery**
    *   What is the role of **DNA Polymerase**?
    *   What is the role of **RNA Polymerase**?
    *   What is the role of the **Ribosome**?

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Replication**
    *   DNA Replication is **Semi-Conservative**. Explain what this means.
    *   Why is there a **Leading Strand** (continuous) and a **Lagging Strand** (Okazaki fragments)? (Hint: Directionality of the enzyme).

5.  **Translation Practice**
    *   **Scenario**: You have a DNA template strand: **3' - TAC GGG AAA ACT - 5'**.
    *   **Apply**:
        *   Transcribe it to mRNA (Remember U replaces T, and 5'/3' flip).
        *   Translate it to Amino Acids (using a codon chart).

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **RNA Processing**
    *   In eukaryotes, the mRNA is "edited" before leaving the nucleus. Explain the purpose of:
        *   **Introns** vs **Exons**.
        *   The **5' Cap** and **Poly-A Tail**.
    *   **Critique**: Why might "Alternative Splicing" be useful? (Can one gene make more than one protein?).

7.  **Universal Code**
    *   The Genetic Code is universal (bacteria use the same codons as humans). **Analyze**: How does this fact support the theory of evolution? How does it make biotechnology (like making insulin in bacteria) possible?
