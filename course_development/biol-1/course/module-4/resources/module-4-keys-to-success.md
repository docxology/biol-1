# Module 4: Cells
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  **Differentiate** between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on structure and complexity.
2.  **Identify** and describe the function of major eukaryotic organelles.
3.  **Trace** the production and transport of cellular products through the endomembrane system.
4.  **Explain** the Endosymbiotic Theory regarding the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*
- [ ] **Cytoplasm**: The jelly-like fluid filing the cell.
- [ ] **Plasma Membrane**: The boundary of the cell.
- [ ] **Organelle**: "Little organ"; specialized structure within a cell.
- [ ] **Ribosome**: The site of protein synthesis.
- [ ] **Cytoskeleton**: Network of fibers (microtubules, microfilaments) holding the cell together.
- [ ] **ATP**: The energy currency generated by mitochondria.

### Concept Check
#### 1. The Limits of Size
*   **Question**: Why do cells have to be as small as they are?
*   **Deep Dive**: Imagine a cell is a balloon. As you blow it up, the inside (volume) grows huge, but the rubber skin (surface area) stretches thin. If the membrane is the "mouth" of the cell, can a tiny mouth feed a giant body?

#### 2. Prokaryote Simplicity
*   **Question**: In what major way do prokaryotic cells differ from eukaryotic cells?
*   **Deep Dive**: Prokaryotes lack a nucleus. Where is their DNA kept? (The Nucleoid region). They are simple, but successful—are there more bacteria on Earth or humans?

#### 3. Powering the Cell
*   **Question**: What is the role of mitochondria in a cell?
*   **Deep Dive**: Mitochondria perform **Cellular Respiration**. They use Oxygen and Sugar to make ATP. Which cells in your body would need the *most* mitochondria? (Muscle cells? Brain cells? Why?).

#### 4. Clean Up Crew
*   **Question**: What do lysosomes do?
*   **Deep Dive**: Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes. What happens if a lysosome bursts *inside* the cell? (This is actually a mechanism for programmed cell death, or Apoptosis).

### Study Tips
*   **Cell City**: Do not just memorize the list of organelles. Assign them a job in a city or a factory. It makes the abstract functions concrete.
*   **Draw two cells**: Draw a Plant Cell and an Animal Cell side-by-side.
    *   Highlight the differences (Wall, Chloroplast, Vacuole).
    *   Review the shared structures (Nucleus, Mitochondria, ER).
*   **Prefixes**:
    *   *Cyto-* = Cell.
    *   *Pro-* = Before.
    *   *Eu-* = True.
    *   *Kary-* = Nucleus.
