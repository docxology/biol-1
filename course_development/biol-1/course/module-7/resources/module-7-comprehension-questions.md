# Module 7: Photosynthesis
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **The Big Picture**
    *   Write the balanced chemical equation for Photosynthesis. Identify which reactant is "reduced" to make sugar and which is "oxidized" to make oxygen.
    *   Compare **Autotrophs** (producers) and **Heterotrophs** (consumers).

2.  **Anatomy of a Chloroplast**
    *   Define **Thylakoid**, **Granum**, and **Stroma**.
    *   Where exactly do the Light Reactions take place? Where does the Calvin Cycle take place?

3.  **Pigments**
    *   Why are plants green? Explain in terms of absorption and reflection of light wavelengths.
    *   What is the role of an **Antenna Complex** in a photosystem?

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **The Light Reactions**
    *   Trace the path of an electron from Water to NADPH.
    *   **Crucial Concept**: Why is water split (Photolysis) at Photosystem II? What waste product is produced?
    *   How is ATP generated during the light reactions? (Hint: Proton gradient).

5.  **The Calvin Cycle (Dark Reactions)**
    *   The Calvin Cycle builds sugar (G3P) from CO2. What two energy molecules from the Light Reactions are required to power this?
    *   What is **Rubisco** and why is it possibly the most important protein on Earth?

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Evolutionary Adaptations**
    *   In hot, dry climates, plants must close their stomata to save water, which leads to photorespiration (wasteful). Analyze how **C4** and **CAM** plants solve this problem.
    *   **Compare**: Corn (C4) vs. a Cactus (CAM). How do they differ in *when* or *where* they fix carbon?

7.  **Global Impact**
    *   Photosynthesis removed massive amounts of CO2 from the ancient atmosphere and filled it with O2. Analyze how this event shaped the evolution of life (i.e., aerobic respiration).
