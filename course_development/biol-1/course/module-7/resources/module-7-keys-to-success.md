# Module 7: Photosynthesis
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  **Trace** the flow of energy from sunlight to chemical bonds in glucose.
2.  **Locate** the specific reactions of photosynthesis within the chloroplast structure.
3.  **Explain** the inputs and outputs of the Light Reactions and the Calvin Cycle.
4.  **Differentiate** between C3, C4, and CAM photosynthetic strategies.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*
- [ ] **Photon**: A particle of light.
- [ ] **Stomata**: Pores in the leaf for gas exchange (CO2 in, O2 out).
- [ ] **Carbon Fixation**: Converting inorganic CO2 into organic molecules.
- [ ] **NADP+ / NADPH**: The electron carrier shuttle.
- [ ] **G3P**: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, the direct product of the Calvin Cycle (precursor to glucose).

### Concept Check
#### 1. The Split
*   **Question**: What is the product of photosystem II and what is the mechanism for creating it?
*   **Deep Dive**: This is arguably the most important reaction for animal life. Water (H2O) is split. The electrons feed the photosytem, the H+ helps make ATP, and the O2 is released for us to breathe.

#### 2. Fixing Gas
*   **Question**: What does it mean to fix a gas?
*   **Deep Dive**: It means taking a gas (CO2) which floats around and attaching it to a solid organic molecule so it becomes part of the plant's "body." Rubisco is the enzyme that does the fixing.

#### 3. Different Strokes
*   **Question**: What environmental pressures led to CAM/C4 evolution?
*   **Deep Dive**: **C3** plants (normal) struggle in heat because RuBisCO accidentally grabs Oxygen instead of CO2 (Photorespiration).
    *   **C4**: Separates capture and fixation by *Space* (different cells).
    *   **CAM**: Separates capture and fixation by *Time* (open pores at night, fix largely during day).

### Study Tips
*   **Follow the Carbon**:
    *   In: CO2 (Air)
    *   Process: Calvin Cycle (Stroma)
    *   Out: Sugar (Food)
*   **Follow the Energy**:
    *   In: Light (Sun)
    *   Process: Light Reactions (Thylakoid)
    *   Intermediate: ATP/NADPH
    *   End: Chemical bonds in Sugar.
*   **Compare**: Make a T-Chart comparing Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration. Notice how they are almost exact opposites?
