# Module 10: Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  **Contrast** the outcomes of Asexual and Sexual reproduction.
2.  **Distinguish** between Homologous Chromosomes and Sister Chromatids.
3.  **Diagram** the phases of Meiosis I and II.
4.  **Explain** the three sources of genetic variation: Crossing Over, Independent Assortment, and Random Fertilization.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*
- [ ] **Allele**: Alternative forms of a gene (e.g., Blue eye gene vs. Brown eye gene).
- [ ] **Karyotype**: A visual display of an individual's chromosomes arranged in pairs.
- [ ] **Synapsis**: The fussing of homologous chromosomes during Prophase I.
- [ ] **Tetrad**: The structure formed by two homologous chromosomes (4 chromatids).
- [ ] **Euploidy**: The correct number of chromosomes.
- [ ] **Aneuploidy**: An abnormal number of chromosomes (+1 or -1).

### Concept Check
#### 1. The Reductive Division
*   **Question**: What separates during meiosis I? Meiosis II?
*   **Deep Dive**: This is the most common exam mistake.
    *   **Meiosis I**: Homologous Pairs separate from each other. (Diploid -> Haploid).
    *   **Meiosis II**: Sister Chromatids separate. (Haploid -> Haploid).

#### 2. The Variation Machine
*   **Question**: Why is genetic variation so important?
*   **Deep Dive**: Variation is the raw material for adaptation. If a population is identical (clones) and a new disease arrives, it kills everyone. If there is variation, some might survive.

#### 3. Counting Chromosomes
*   **Question**: How many chromosomes do humans have?
*   **Deep Dive**: 46 total.
    *   22 Pairs of Autosomes (Instructions for body).
    *   1 Pair of Sex Chromosomes (XX or XY).
    *   Gametes (Sperm/Egg) have 23 *total* chromosomes (no pairs).

#### 4. Errors
*   **Question**: What is a nondisjunction?
*   **Deep Dive**: Failure to separate. It leads to gametes with n+1 or n-1 chromosomes.
    *   n+1 sperm + n egg = 2n+1 (Trisomy).
    *   n-1 sperm + n egg = 2n-1 (Monosomy).

### Study Tips
*   **Dance of the Chromosomes**:
    *   Imagine two pairs of shoes (Dad's boots, Mom's heels).
    *   **Replication**: Photocopy each shoe. Now you have two boots tied together (Sisters) and two heels tied together (Sisters).
    *   **Metaphase I**: The Boots pair up with the Heels. (Homologous pair).
    *   **Anaphase I**: Boots go left, Heels go right.
    *   **Metaphase II**: The tie snaps. Single shoes separate.
*   **Focus on Prophase I**: This is where the magic happens (Crossing Over). It's the longest phase.
