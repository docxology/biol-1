# Module 6: Metabolism
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **Energy Basics**
    *   Differentiate between **Kinetic** and **Potential** energy using biological examples (e.g., a concentration gradient vs. muscle movement).
    *   State the **First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics**. How do living things obey the second law (entropy) while creating ordered structures?

2.  **Enzymes**
    *   What is **Activation Energy**? How do enzymes lower it?
    *   Explain the difference between **Competitive** and **Non-competitive** inhibition. Where does the inhibitor bind in each case?

3.  **ATP Structure**
    *   Draw or describe the structure of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). Which bond is the "high energy" bond that is broken to release energy?

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Metabolic Pathways**
    *   Compare **Anabolic** (building up) and **Catabolic** (breaking down) pathways.
    *   **Application**: Is photosynthesis anabolic or catabolic? Is cellular respiration anabolic or catabolic? Explain your reasoning.

5.  **Enzyme Regulation**
    *   **Scenario**: You have an enzyme that functions best in the human stomach (pH 2).
    *   **Apply**: What happens to this enzyme's activity if it is moved to the blood (pH 7.4)? Explain *why* in terms of protein structure (denaturation).

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Redox Reactions**
    *   "OIL RIG" stands for *Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain* (of electrons). Analyze the following generic reaction: A- + B -> A + B-. Which molecule was oxidized? Which was reduced?

7.  **Feedback Loops**
    *   Explain the concept of **Feedback Inhibition**. Why is it efficient for the end-product of a pathway to shut down the first enzyme in that pathway?
