# Module 9: Cell Division and Mitosis
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **The DNA Blueprint**
    *   Define **Genome**, **Chromosome**, **Chromatin**, and **Gene**.
    *   Differentiate between **Haploid (n)** and **Diploid (2n)** cells. What are the numbers for humans?

2.  **The Cell Cycle**
    *   List the phases of the Cell Cycle (**Interphase** + **Mitotic Phase**).
    *   What happens during **G1**, **S**, and **G2** phases of Interphase? Which phase involves DNA replication?

3.  **Mitosis Phases**
    *   Describe the major events of **Prophase**, **Metaphase**, **Anaphase**, and **Telophase**.
    *   What is the role of the **Spindle Fibers** and **Centrosomes**?

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Cytokinesis**
    *   Mitosis divides the nucleus; Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm. Compare how this process looks in **Animal Cells** (Cleavage Furrow) vs. **Plant Cells** (Cell Plate).
    *   Why can't plant cells just pinch in two like animal cells?

5.  **Control and Regulation**
    *   The cell cycle has "Checkpoints" (G1, G2, M). What is the cell checking for at each point?
    *   Explain the role of **Apoptosis** (Programmed Cell Death). Why would a cell voluntarily kill itself?

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Cancer Biology**
    *   Defined Cancer in terms of the cell cycle.
    *   Differentiate between **Proto-oncogenes** and **Tumor Suppressor Genes** (like p53). Analogy: Which is the gas pedal and which is the brake?
    *   What is the difference between a **Benign** and **Malignant** tumor?

7.  **Prokaryotic Division**
    *   Bacteria do not do Mitosis. Describe **Binary Fission**. Why is it simpler?
