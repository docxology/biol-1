# Module 2: Basic Chemistry
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **Atomic Structure**
    *   Identify the three subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons). Describe their location within the atom, relative mass, and electrical charge.
    *   What determines the "identity" of an atom (i.e., which element it is)?

2.  **Chemical Bonding**
    *   Define the **Octet Rule**. Why do atoms form bonds?
    *   Differentiate between the three major types of bonds in biological systems: **Ionic**, **Covalent** (polar and non-polar), and **Hydrogen** bonds.

3.  **Properties of Water**
    *   Explain why water is considered a "polar" molecule. How does this polarity lead to hydrogen bonding?
    *   List four distinct properties of water that are critical for life (e.g., cohesion, high specific heat).

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **pH and Buffers**
    *   The pH scale is logarithmic. Mathematically, how much more acidic is a solution with pH 3 compared to pH 6?
    *   Explain the role of **buffers** in biological systems (like human blood). What happens if a biological system's pH shifts too drastically?

5.  **Isotopes in Biology**
    *   **Scenario**: A paleontologist finds a fossil and wants to know its age.
    *   **Apply**: How can **radioactive isotopes** (like Carbon-14) be used to solve this problem? What is "half-life"?

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Reactivity and Stability**
    *   Analyze the relationship between an atom's electron shell configuration and its chemical reactivity. Why are "Noble Gases" (like Helium or Neon) generally unreactive?

7.  **Water in Ecosystems**
    *   Water becomes less dense when it freezes (ice floats). Analyze how this specific property affects aquatic life in a lake during winter. What would happen if ice sank?
