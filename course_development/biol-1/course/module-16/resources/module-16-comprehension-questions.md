# Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **Defining Microevolution**
    *   Evolution is "change in allele frequency." If a population is 50% Brown Eye Alleles and 50% Blue Eye Alleles, and 100 years later it is 90% Brown/10% Blue, has evolution occurred?

2.  **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**
    *   What does the Hardy-Weinberg principle state?
    *   List the **Five Conditions** required for a population NOT to evolve (No mutation, No gene flow, etc.). Are these conditions common in nature?

3.  **Genetic Drift**
    *   Define **Genetic Drift**. Does it have a stronger effect on Large or Small populations?
    *   Distinguish between the **Bottleneck Effect** (disaster) and the **Founder Effect** (colonization).

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Types of Selection**
    *   Draw three graphs representing:
        *   **Directional Selection** (Shift to one extreme).
        *   **Stabilizing Selection** (Average is favored).
        *   **Disruptive Selection** (Both extremes favored).
    *   Give a real-world example of each (e.g., Birth weight, Beak size).

5.  **Heterozygote Advantage**
    *   Sickle Cell Anemia is a deadly recessive disease. Why is the allele so common in parts of Africa?
    *   **Apply**: How does this demonstrate that "Fitness" depends on the environment? (Malaria presence).

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Sexual Selection**
    *   Peacocks have giant tails that make them slow and visible to predators. **Analyze**: How can Natural Selection (survival) allow this trait to exist? (Hint: Reproduction vs Survival).

7.  **Gene Flow**
    *   Two populations of deer are separated by a mountain. A tunnel is built, allowing them to mix.
    *   **Analyze**: Will the two populations become more similar or more different genetically? Does this increase or decrease the chance of them becoming separate species?
