# Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  **Calculate** allele and genotype frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg equations.
2.  **Differentiate** between the effects of Genetic Drift, Gene Flow, and Natural Selection.
3.  **Identify** patterns of selection (Stabilizing, Directional, Disruptive) from data.
4.  **Explain** how Heterozygote Advantage maintains deadly alleles in a population.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*
- [ ] **Gene Pool**: All the alleles in a population.
- [ ] **Microevolution**: Small-scale changes in allele frequencies generation to generation.
- [ ] **Sexual Dimorphism**: Differences in appearance between males and females.
- [ ] **Gene Flow**: Movement of alleles between populations (Migration).
- [ ] **Bottleneck Effect**: Loss of genetic diversity due to a drastic reduction in population size.

### Concept Check
#### 1. The Null Hypothesis
*   **Question**: What are the 5 criteria for stable allele frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg)?
*   **Deep Dive**:
    1.  No Mutation.
    2.  No Gene Flow.
    3.  No Natural Selection.
    4.  Random Mating.
    5.  Extremely Large Population.
    *   *Real Talk*: This basically never happens. Evolution is inevitable.

#### 2. The Math
*   **Question**: What are the two equations?
*   **Deep Dive**:
    *   **p + q = 1** (Allele Frequency: Dominant + Recessive = 100%).
    *   **p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1** (Genotype Frequency: AA + Aa + aa = 100%).
    *   *Tip*: Always find **q** (recessive frequency) first. You can "see" recessive phenotypes. You can't see carriers.

#### 3. Luck of the Draw
*   **Question**: What is genetic drift?
*   **Deep Dive**: Random chance. If you flip a coin 1000 times, it's 50/50. If you flip it 4 times, you might get 100% heads. Small populations (4 flips) are subject to wild random swings (Drift). Large populations are stable.

### Study Tips
*   **Graphs**: Memorize the shapes of selection graphs.
    *   **Directional**: Bell curve moves Left/Right.
    *   **Stabilizing**: Bell curve gets skinny/tall (Variance decreases).
    *   **Disruptive**: Bell curve gets two humps (M shape).
*   **Peacock Logic**: Sexual Selection is powerful. If females prefer long tails, males get long tails, even if it kills them. Copulation > Survival.
