# Module 5: Membranes
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **Membrane Architecture**
    *   Describe the **Fluid Mosaic Model**. Why is the membrane described as "fluid"? What makes up the "mosaic"?
    *   Sketch a **Phospholipid**. Label the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. Explain how this structure naturally forms a bilayer in water.

2.  **Permeability**
    *   Membranes are **Selectively Permeable**. What types of molecules can pass through freely? What types need help (transport proteins)? giving examples of each.

3.  **Transport Mechanisms**
    *   Define **Diffusion**. Does it require energy?
    *   Define **Osmosis**. In which direction does water move? (Towards high solute or low solute?)

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Tonicity**
    *   **Scenario**: Red blood cells are placed in three beakers:
        *   Beaker A: Pure distilled water.
        *   Beaker B: A salt solution matching the blood.
        *   Beaker C: A very salty syrup.
    *   **Apply**: Predict what happens to the cells in each beaker (Swell/Burst, Stay the same, Shrivel). Identify which solution is **Hypotonic**, **Isotonic**, and **Hypertonic**.

5.  **Active Transport**
    *   Contrast **Passive Transport** (Diffusion/Facilitated Diffusion) with **Active Transport**.
    *   The **Sodium-Potassium Pump** is a classic example of active transport. What is being moved? Is it moving with or against the gradient? Why does this cost ATP?

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Bulk Transport**
    *   Some molecules are too big for protein channels. Describe **Endocytosis** (Phagocytosis/Pinocytosis) and **Exocytosis**.
    *   **Analysis**: How do these processes rely on the "fluidity" of the membrane you described in Question 1?

7.  **Cell Signaling**
    *   Membranes are not just barriers; they are communication hubs. Explain the role of **Receptor Proteins** and **Glycoproteins** (ID tags). How does a cell "know" a hormone is outside?
