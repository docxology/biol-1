# Module 15: Darwin and Evolution
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **Darwin's Big Idea**
    *   Define **Natural Selection**.
    *   What is "Descent with Modification"?
    *   Does an *individual* evolve, or does a *population* evolve?

2.  **The Requirements**
    *   Natural selection isn't magic; it requires specific conditions. Explain why **Heritable Variation**, **Competition/Overproduction**, and **Differential Survival** are necessary for evolution to occur.

3.  **Fitness**
    *   In evolutionary biology, "Survival of the Fittest" doesn't mean the strongest. What does **Fitness** actually mean? (Hint: Offspring).

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Evidence: Anatomy**
    *   Differentiate between **Homologous Structures** (e.g., human arm vs bat wing) and **Analogous Structures** (e.g., bird wing vs insect wing). Which one suggests a common ancestor?
    *   What is a **Vestigial Structure**? Give a human example (Appendix? Tailbone?).

5.  **Evidence: Biochemical**
    *   All life on Earth uses DNA and the same 20 amino acids. How is this strong evidence for a universal common ancestor?
    *   If Human hemoglobin is more similar to Chimpanzee hemoglobin than to Dog hemoglobin, what does that imply about our evolutionary history?

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Mechanisms of Change**
    *   **Scenario**: A farmer sprays a pesticide on his corn. 99% of the bugs die. Next year, he sprays again, but only 50% die.
    *   **Analysis**: Did the bugs "learn" to survive? Did the pesticide cause mutations? Explain how **Natural Selection** created this resistant population.

7.  **Artificial Selection**
    *   Humans bred wolves into Chihuahuas and Great Danes. How is **Artificial Selection** similar to Natural Selection? How is it different?
