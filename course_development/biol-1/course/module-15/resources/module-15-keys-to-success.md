# Module 15: Darwin and Evolution
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  **Describe** the key components of Darwin's theory of Natural Selection.
2.  **Contrast** Homologous and Analogous structures as evidence for evolution.
3.  **Explain** how fossil and biochemical evidence supports the theory of common descent.
4.  **Apply** the concept of "fitness" to evolutionary scenarios.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*
- [ ] **Adaptation**: A trait that increases survival/reproduction in a specific environment.
- [ ] **Biogeography**: The study of the distribution of species across the planet.
- [ ] **Transitional Fossil**: A fossil that shows intermediate states between an ancestral form and its descendants.
- [ ] **Convergent Evolution**: Different species independently evolving similar traits (Analogous structures).
- [ ] **Industrial Melanism**: The classic example of moths changing color due to soot pollution.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Misconception Busting
*   **Question**: What is the most basic definition of evolution?
*   **Deep Dive**: "Change in allele frequency over time."
*   **Important**: Individuals do NOT evolve. You cannot change your DNA. Populations evolve over generations.

#### 2. Darwin's Inspiration
*   **Question**: How did the Galapagos finches inspire Darwin?
*   **Deep Dive**: He noticed distinct beak shapes on different islands.
    *   Big beaks = Nut crackers (Dry islands).
    *   Small beaks = Insect eaters.
    *   Conclusion: One ancestor arrived, and they adapted to different niches (*Adaptive Radiation*).

#### 3. Old Bones
*   **Question**: What are homologous structures?
*   **Deep Dive**: Same Bone Structure, Different Job.
    *   Whale flipper, Human hand, Bat wing.
    *   They all have 1 bone -> 2 bones -> little bones format.
    *   Proof they are related.

### Study Tips
*   **Lamarck vs Darwin**:
    *   **Lamarck** (Wrong): "The giraffe stretched its neck, so its baby had a long neck." (Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics).
    *   **Darwin** (Right): "Giraffes with slightly longer necks survived better and had more babies. Short neck giraffes died."
*   **"Theory"**: Remember, in science, a Theory is a massive explanation supported by facts (Gravity, Cell Theory, Evolution). It is not a hunch.
