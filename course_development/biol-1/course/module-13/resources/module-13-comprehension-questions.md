# Module 13: Regulation of Gene Expression
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **Prokaryotic Regulation**
    *   Define **Operon**.
    *   Compare an **Inducible Operon** (like *lac*) vs. a **Repressible Operon** (like *trp*). Which one is normally "OFF" and needs to be turned on? Which is normally "ON"?

2.  **Eukaryotic Regulation**
    *   Gene expression isn't just ON/OFF; it's a dimmer switch controlled at many levels. Briefly explain:
        *   **Chromatin Remodeling** (Histone acetylation).
        *   **Transcriptional Control** (Transcription factors).
        *   **Post-Translational Control** (Protein folding/degradation).

3.  **Mutations**
    *   Define **Point Mutation** (Substitution) vs. **Frameshift Mutation** (Insertion/Deletion).
    *   Why is a frameshift usually much more damaging?

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **The Lac Operon**
    *   **Scenario**: E. coli bacteria are living for weeks in a petri dish with ample Glucose and NO Lactose.
    *   **Apply**: Is the *lac* operon on or off? Is the Repressor protein bound to the operator?
    *   **Change**: You suddenly add Lactose. What happens to the repressor? What happens to transcription?

5.  **X-Inactivation**
    *   Female mammals have two X chromosomes, but males survive with only one. Explain **Dosage Compensation** and **Barr Bodies**.
    *   How does this explain the patchy color of a Tortoiseshell/Calico cat?

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Cancer and Regulation**
    *   Cancer is essentially a disease of gene regulation.
    *   **Analyze**: How might a mutation in a **Tumor Suppressor Gene** (which normally stops division) lead to cancer?
    *   How might a mutation in a **Proto-Oncogene** (which normally promotes division) lead to cancer?

7.  **Epigenetics**
    *   "Inheritance above the genes." Explain how environmental factors (diet, stress) might modify chemical tags on DNA (Methylation) without changing the sequence itself. Can these changes be passed to offspring?
