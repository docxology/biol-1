# Module 14: Biotechnology and Genomics
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **The Toolbox**
    *   What is a **Restriction Enzyme**? How do "sticky ends" help connect two different pieces of DNA?
    *   What is a **Vector** (e.g., a plasmid)? How is it used to get foreign DNA into a bacterium?

2.  **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)**
    *   Describe the three steps of PCR: **Denaturation**, **Annealing**, and **Extension**.
    *   Why is PCR often called "Molecular photocopying"? Why is it useful at a crime scene with a tiny blood sample?

3.  **Visualizing DNA**
    *   Explain how **Gel Electrophoresis** separates DNA fragments.
    *   Do smaller fragments move faster or slower? Why? (Think about moving through a thick jungle).

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Genetic Engineering**
    *   Define **Transgenic Organism** (GMO).
    *   **Scenario**: You want to make bacteria that produce human insulin. Outline the steps you would take. (Cut gene, cut plasmid, glue together, insert into bacteria).

5.  **DNA Fingerprinting**
    *   **Application**: You are looking at a DNA gel from a paternity test. The Child has bands at position A and B. The Mother has a band at A.
    *   Does the Father *have* to have a band at B? Explain your reasoning.

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Gene Therapy**
    *   Differentiate between **Ex Vivo** (cells treated outside body) and **In Vivo** (treated inside body) gene therapy.
    *   **Evaluate**: What are the biggest challenges in gene therapy? (Hint: Delivery and Immune response).

7.  **Genomics**
    *   We have sequenced the entire human genome. **Analyze**: Why does knowing the sequence of letters (A,C,T,G) not immediately tell us what every gene does? What is distinct about **Functional Genomics**?
