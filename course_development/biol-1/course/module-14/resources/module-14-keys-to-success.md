# Module 14: Biotechnology and Genomics
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  **Explain** the function of restriction enzymes and ligase in creating recombinant DNA.
2.  **Describe** the steps and purpose of PCR and Gel Electrophoresis.
3.  **Evaluate** the benefits and risks of Transgenic Organisms (GMOs).
4.  **Discuss** the goals and methods of Gene Therapy.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*
- [ ] **Recombinant DNA**: DNA containing genetic material from two different sources.
- [ ] **Plasmid**: Small circular DNA ring in bacteria; often used as a vector.
- [ ] **DNA Ligase**: The "glue" enzyme that seals DNA backbone breaks.
- [ ] **STR (Short Tandem Repeat)**: Highly variable DNA sections used for fingerprinting.
- [ ] **Bioinformatics**: Using computers to analyze biological data.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Cut and Paste
*   **Question**: What two enzymes are needed to create recombinant vectors?
*   **Deep Dive**:
    *   **Scissors**: Restriction Enzymes (Cut specific sequences).
    *   **Glue**: DNA Ligase (SEals the backbone).

#### 2. The Electric Race
*   **Question**: How does gel electrophoresis work?
*   **Deep Dive**: DNA is Negatively charged (Phosphate groups). When you turn on the power, DNA runs toward the Positive pole.
    *   Small pieces -> Run fast/far.
    *   Big pieces -> Get stuck/slow.

#### 3. New Life Forms
*   **Question**: What are some beneficial uses of transgenic organisms?
*   **Deep Dive**:
    *   **Bacteria**: Making Insulin or Human Growth Hormone.
    *   **Plants**: Golden Rice (Vitamin A), Pest-resistant corn.
    *   **Animals**: Goats making medicine in milk.

### Study Tips
*   **PCR Song**: Think of it like cooking.
    *   **Heat it up** (95C) -> Separate strands.
    *   **Cool it down** (50C) -> Primers stick.
    *   **Warm it up** (72C) -> Build new DNA.
    *   *Repeat*.
*   **Crime Scene Logic**: In a DNA fingerprint, every single band in the child MUST come from either Mom or Dad. If a band matches neither, it's not their kid.
