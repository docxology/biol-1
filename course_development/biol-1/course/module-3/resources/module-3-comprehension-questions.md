# Module 3: Organic Molecules
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
1.  **The Nature of Organic Molecules**
    *   What does it mean for a molecule to be "organic"? Why is Carbon considered the "backbone" of life?
    *   Define **Functional Group**. Give one example (e.g., Hydroxyl, Amino) and explain how it changes a molecule's properties.

2.  **Building Blocks**
    *   Explain the relationship between **Monomers** and **Polymers**.
    *   Describe the reactions involved in building polymers (**Dehydration Synthesis**) and breaking them down (**Hydrolysis**). Which one requires water? Which one releases water?

3.  **The Four Classes of Biomolecules**
    *   Create a summary table comparing **Carbohydrates**, **Lipids**, **Proteins**, and **Nucleic Acids**. Include:
        *   Monomer name
        *   Key function(s)
        *   Example molecule

### Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
4.  **Protein Folding**
    *   Protein function is entirely dependent on shape. Explain the four levels of protein structure:
        *   **Primary**: Sequence of amino acids.
        *   **Secondary**: Alpha helices and Beta sheets.
        *   **Tertiary**: 3D folding (R-group interactions).
        *   **Quaternary**: Multiple polypeptide chains.
    *   **Apply**: What happens during **denaturation**? Does a cooked egg turn back into a raw egg when cooled? Why?

5.  **Lipids and Diet**
    *   Distinguish between **Saturated** and **Unsaturated** fatty acids. How does the double bond in unsaturated fats affect their physical state at room temperature (solid vs. liquid)?

### Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
6.  **Structure Determines Function**
    *   Cellulose (in plants) and Starch (in potatoes) are both made of glucose. Why can we digest starch but not cellulose (fiber)? Analyze how the bonding structure affects enzymatic breakdown.

7.  **ATP as Energy**
    *   ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is a nucleic acid derivative. Analyze its structure. Where is the "energy" actually stored? Why is it considered the "energy currency" of the cell?
