# Module 3: Organic Molecules
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  **Classify** the four major groups of biological macromolecules and identifying their constituent monomers.
2.  **Explain** the chemical reactions (dehydration synthesis/hydrolysis) that build and break polymers.
3.  **Correlate** the structural levels of proteins with their specific functions and vulnerability to denaturation.
4.  **Differentiate** between DNA, RNA, and ATP in terms of structure and function.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*
- [ ] **Macromolecule**: A giant molecule formed by the joining of smaller molecules.
- [ ] **Hydrophobic**: Repelling water (characteristic of lipids).
- [ ] **Peptide Bond**: The covalent bond between two amino acid units.
- [ ] **Nucleotide**: Assembled from a sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base.
- [ ] **Enzyme**: A protein that acts as a catalyst.
- [ ] **Phospholipid**: The key structural component of cell membranes.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Carbohydrate Complexity
*   **Question**: What is the most main role of carbohydrates?
*   **Deep Dive**: How does the structure of a storage polysaccharide (like **Glycogen**) differ from a structural polysaccharide (like **Cellulose**)? Why is branching important for quick energy release?

#### 2. The Lipid Family
*   **Question**: What is the solubility of lipids?
*   **Deep Dive**: Why are steroids (like cholesterol and testosterone) grouped with fats and oils even though they look completely different (ring structure)? (Hint: Do they mix with water?)

#### 3. Protein Versatility
*   **Question**: What are at least 6 roles of proteins?
*   **Deep Dive**: Proteins do almost everything (transport, enzymes, defense, structure). If a genetic mutation changes just *one* amino acid in the primary sequence (like in Sickle Cell Anemia), why does it have such catastrophic effects on the whole organism?

#### 4. Nucleic Acid Code
*   **Question**: How do the two strands found in a DNA molecule stick together?
*   **Deep Dive**: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. If a DNA sample is 20% Adenine, what percentage is Guanine? (Chargaff's Rule).

### Study Tips
*   **Use your hands**: To understand Protein folding, use a piece of wire or a pipe cleaner.
    *   Straight = Primary.
    *   Coiled = Secondary.
    *   Ballet up into a glob = Tertiary.
*   **Suffixes**: Learn to recognize chemical names.
    *   *-ose* = Sugar (Glucose, Fructose).
    *   *-ase* = Enzyme (Lactase, Amylase).
    *   *-in* = Often a protein (Hemoglobin, Insulin).
*   **Flashcards for Monomers**:
    *   Carbs -> Monosaccharides.
    *   Proteins -> Amino Acids.
    *   Nucleic Acids -> Nucleotides.
    *   Lipids -> (No true monomer, but Glycerol + Fatty Acids).
