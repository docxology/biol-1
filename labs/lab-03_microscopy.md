# Lab 3: Introduction to Light Microscopy

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Identify and label the parts of a compound light microscope
- Demonstrate proper microscope handling and focusing techniques
- Prepare and observe specimens under low and high power
- Draw accurate scientific illustrations of microscopic observations
- Make detailed observations and formulate questions about what you see

---

## Materials

- Compound light microscope (1 per group)
- Prepared slides (provided by instructor)
- Lens paper

---

## Part 1: Microscope Anatomy & Labeling

> **Learning Goal:** Become familiar with the parts of a compound light microscope and their functions.

Using the microscope at your station, examine its parts carefully. In the large box below, **draw your microscope** and label it using the terms from the list.

<!-- lab:drawing-area title="Microscope Drawing" height=500 -->

**Draw your compound light microscope here:**

{fill:drawing height=400}

<!-- /lab:drawing-area -->

### Terms to Label on Your Drawing

Use the following terms to label your drawing. Draw lines from each part to its label on your diagram.

| Term | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Eyepiece (Ocular Lens)** | Lens you look through; typically 10× magnification |
| **Objective Lenses** | Rotating lenses providing different magnifications (4×, 10×, 40×) |
| **Revolving Nosepiece** | Rotates to change objective lenses |
| **Stage** | Platform where the slide is placed |
| **Stage Clips** | Hold the slide in place on the stage |
| **Coarse Adjustment Knob** | Large knob for rough focusing (use only with low power) |
| **Fine Adjustment Knob** | Small knob for precise focusing |
| **Diaphragm/Iris** | Controls the amount of light passing through specimen |
| **Light Source** | Illuminates the specimen from below |
| **Arm** | Used to carry the microscope; connects body to base |
| **Base** | Bottom support of the microscope |

**After drawing and labeling, answer these questions:**

1. What is the total magnification when using the 10× eyepiece and the 40× objective lens?

{fill:text}

1. Why should you always start focusing with the lowest power objective lens?

{fill:textarea rows=2}

1. Why is it important to never use the coarse adjustment knob with high power objectives?

## Summary

| Part | Skill | What You Learned |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Microscope Anatomy | Parts and functions of a light microscope |
| 2-4 | Specimen Observation | Drawing, describing, and questioning microscopic specimens |
| 2-4 | Scientific Illustration | Creating accurate drawings of what you observe |
| 2-4 | Inquiry | Generating questions from careful observation |

**Key Takeaway:** Light microscopy reveals a hidden world invisible to the naked eye. Scientific observation requires careful attention to detail and accurate documentation of what we see.
