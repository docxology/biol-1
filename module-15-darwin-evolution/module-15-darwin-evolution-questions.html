<h1>Module 15: Darwin and Evolution</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define natural selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is "descent with modification"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does an individual evolve, or does a population evolve?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain why heritable variation, competition, and differential survival are necessary for evolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In evolutionary biology, what does "fitness" mean? (Reproductive success)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiate homologous structures (common ancestry) from analogous structures (convergent evolution).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a vestigial structure? Provide a human example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All life uses DNA and the same genetic code. How does this support common ancestry?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If human hemoglobin is more similar to chimpanzee hemoglobin than dog hemoglobin, what does this imply?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scenario**: A farmer sprays pesticide. 99% of insects die. Next year, only 50% die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the insects "learn" resistance? Explain using natural selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans bred wolves into diverse dog breeds. How is artificial selection similar to and different from natural selection?</p>
