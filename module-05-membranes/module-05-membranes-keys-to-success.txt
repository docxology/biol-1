Module 5: Membranes — Keys to Success

Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Describe the fluid mosaic model
Explain the structure and function of phospholipids
Distinguish passive from active transport
Predict osmosis in different solutions
Compare types of bulk transport

Key Terms to Know

Fluid Mosaic Model — Membrane with floating proteins in a phospholipid bilayer
Phospholipid — Molecule with hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails
Selective Permeability — Membrane controls what enters and exits
Diffusion — Movement from high to low concentration
Osmosis — Diffusion of water across a membrane
Facilitated Diffusion — Diffusion with help of proteins
Active Transport — Uses ATP to move against gradient
Isotonic — Equal solute concentration inside and outside
Hypertonic — Higher solute concentration outside
Hypotonic — Lower solute concentration outside
Endocytosis — Bringing materials into cell
Exocytosis — Releasing materials from cell

Key Concepts

| Transport Type | Energy? | Direction | Example |
|---------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Simple Diffusion | No | High → Low | O₂, CO₂ |
| Facilitated Diffusion | No | High → Low | Glucose |
| Active Transport | Yes | Low → High | Na⁺/K⁺ pump |
| Endocytosis | Yes | Into cell | Phagocytosis |
| Exocytosis | Yes | Out of cell | Secretion |

Study Tips

Draw the phospholipid bilayer — Label heads and tails
Memorize tonicity effects — Hypo = swell; Hyper = shrink
Know the Na⁺/K⁺ pump — 3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in, uses ATP
