Module 8: Cellular Respiration
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Map the stages of cellular respiration to their locations in the cell.
Calculate the inputs and outputs (ATP, NADH, FADH₂) for each stage.
Explain the function of the Electron Transport Chain and chemiosmosis.
Compare aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, and fermentation.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Aerobic vs. Anaerobic: Requiring oxygen vs. not requiring oxygen.
[ ] Oxidation: Loss of electrons (glucose is oxidized during respiration).
[ ] Reduction: Gain of electrons (oxygen is reduced to water).
[ ] Chemiosmosis: ATP synthesis driven by the flow of H⁺ ions down their electrochemical gradient through ATP synthase.
[ ] ATP Synthase: The enzyme complex that synthesizes ATP from ADP and Pᵢ.
[ ] Cristae: Inner mitochondrial membrane folds that increase surface area for the ETC.

Concept Check
The Electron Transport Chain
   Question: What is the role of the ETC?
   Key Answer: The ETC transfers electrons through protein complexes, using the released energy to pump H⁺ ions across the inner membrane. The resulting proton gradient drives ATP synthesis via ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation).

Oxygen's Role
   Question: Why is oxygen essential for aerobic respiration?
   Key Answer: Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the ETC. Without it, electrons cannot flow, the proton gradient collapses, and ATP production ceases. Oxygen is reduced to water.

Fermentation
   Question: Why do cells perform fermentation?
   Key Answer: Fermentation regenerates NAD⁺ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue producing 2 ATP per glucose in the absence of oxygen. The carbon in pyruvate is converted to ethanol (yeast) or lactate (muscle) rather than fully oxidized.
