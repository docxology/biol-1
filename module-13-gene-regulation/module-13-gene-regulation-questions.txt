Module 13: Regulation of Gene Expression

Define operon.

Compare inducible operons (lac) vs. repressible operons (trp).

Gene expression is controlled at multiple levels. Briefly explain:

Chromatin remodeling (histone modification)

Transcriptional control (transcription factors)

Post-translational control (protein modification/degradation)

Define point mutation vs. frameshift mutation.

Why are frameshift mutations typically more damaging?

Scenario**: E. coli are growing in glucose-only medium.

Is the lac operon on or off? Is the repressor bound?

What happens when lactose is added?

Explain dosage compensation and Barr body formation.

How does X-inactivation explain calico cat coat patterns?

Cancer results from dysregulated gene expression.

Analyze how mutations in tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes lead to uncontrolled cell division.

Environmental factors (diet, stress) can modify DNA methylation without changing the sequence.

Can these modifications be inherited? Discuss evidence.
