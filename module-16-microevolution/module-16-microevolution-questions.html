<h1>Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a population's allele frequencies change from 50% A / 50% a to 90% A / 10% a, has evolution occurred?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the Hardy-Weinberg principle describe?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List the five conditions required for equilibrium. Are these conditions common in nature?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define genetic drift. Does it affect large or small populations more strongly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distinguish the Bottleneck Effect from the Founder Effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sketch graphs representing:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directional selection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stabilizing selection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disruptive selection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a real-world example of each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sickle cell disease is recessive and often lethal. Why is the allele common in malaria-endemic regions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does this demonstrate that fitness is environment-dependent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peacocks have elaborate tails that increase predation risk. How can natural selection permit this trait?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two deer populations are separated by a mountain. A tunnel allows interbreeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the populations become more similar or more different? What is the effect on speciation potential?</p>
</li>
</ol>
