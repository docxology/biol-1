Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Calculate allele and genotype frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg equations.
Differentiate between the effects of genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection on allele frequencies.
Identify patterns of selection (stabilizing, directional, disruptive) from phenotypic data.
Explain how heterozygote advantage maintains deleterious alleles in a population.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Gene Pool: All alleles in a population.
[ ] Microevolution: Changes in allele frequencies within a population over generations.
[ ] Sexual Dimorphism: Phenotypic differences between males and females of a species.
[ ] Gene Flow: Movement of alleles between populations via migration.
[ ] Bottleneck Effect: A sharp reduction in genetic diversity following a population crash.

Concept Check
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
   Question: What are the five conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
   Key Answer: (1) No mutation, (2) No gene flow, (3) No natural selection, (4) Random mating, (5) Infinite population size. These conditions are rarely met; evolution is inevitable.

Hardy-Weinberg Equations
   Question: What are the two equations?
   Key Answer:
       p + q = 1 (allele frequencies)
       p² + 2pq + q² = 1 (genotype frequencies)
       Start with q² (frequency of homozygous recessive) because this phenotype is identifiable.

Genetic Drift
   Question: What is genetic drift?
Key Answer: Random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events. Drift has a stronger effect on small populations due to sampling error.
