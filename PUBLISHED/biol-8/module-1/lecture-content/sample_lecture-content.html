<h1>Module 1: Ecology Fundamentals</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Ecology</h2>
<p>Ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and their environment. This module introduces fundamental ecological concepts.</p>
<h2>Levels of Ecological Organization</h2>
<h3>Individual</h3>
<p>A single organism responding to environmental conditions.</p>
<h3>Population</h3>
<p>A group of individuals of the same species living in the same area.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>Multiple populations of different species interacting in an area.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>A community of organisms together with their physical environment.</p>
<h3>Biome</h3>
<p>Large-scale ecosystems characterized by climate and vegetation.</p>
<h3>Biosphere</h3>
<p>All life on Earth and the environments in which it exists.</p>
<h2>Abiotic and Biotic Factors</h2>
<h3>Abiotic Factors</h3>
<p>Non-living components of the environment:
- Temperature
- Water availability
- Sunlight
- Soil composition
- pH levels
- Wind patterns</p>
<h3>Biotic Factors</h3>
<p>Living components of the environment:
- Predators
- Prey
- Competitors
- Symbionts
- Decomposers</p>
<h2>Energy Flow in Ecosystems</h2>
<h3>Food Chains and Food Webs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Producers</strong>: Autotrophs that capture energy (plants, algae)</li>
<li><strong>Primary Consumers</strong>: Herbivores that eat producers</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Consumers</strong>: Carnivores that eat primary consumers</li>
<li><strong>Tertiary Consumers</strong>: Top predators</li>
<li><strong>Decomposers</strong>: Break down dead organic matter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy Pyramids</h3>
<p>Energy decreases at each trophic level:
- Only about 10% of energy transfers between levels
- Most energy is lost as heat
- Limits the number of trophic levels</p>
<h2>Nutrient Cycles</h2>
<p>Essential elements cycle through ecosystems:
- <strong>Carbon Cycle</strong>: Movement of carbon through atmosphere, organisms, and Earth
- <strong>Nitrogen Cycle</strong>: Conversion of nitrogen between forms
- <strong>Water Cycle</strong>: Movement of water through ecosystems
- <strong>Phosphorus Cycle</strong>: Movement of phosphorus through ecosystems</p>
<h2>Population Ecology</h2>
<h3>Population Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exponential Growth</strong>: Unlimited growth under ideal conditions</li>
<li><strong>Logistic Growth</strong>: Growth limited by carrying capacity</li>
<li><strong>Carrying Capacity</strong>: Maximum population size an environment can support</li>
</ul>
<h3>Population Regulation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Density-Dependent Factors</strong>: Competition, predation, disease</li>
<li><strong>Density-Independent Factors</strong>: Weather, natural disasters</li>
</ul>
