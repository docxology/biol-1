### 2. Cell Organelles and Their Functions
- Identify major organelles (nucleus, ribosomes, ER, Golgi, mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, vacuoles)
- Describe the function of each organelle
- Understand the relationship between structure and function of organelles

### 3. The Nucleus and Genetic Control
- Describe the structure of the nucleus and its components
- Explain the role of DNA in directing cellular activities
- Understand how information flows from DNA to protein

### 4. The Endomembrane System
- Trace the pathway of proteins through the endomembrane system
- Explain how the ER, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, and plasma membrane work together
- Describe the role of lysosomes in cellular digestion

### 5. Energy Organelles
- Compare mitochondria and chloroplasts in structure and function
- Explain the endosymbiotic theory
- Understand the role of ATP in cellular energy

### 6. Cytoskeleton and Cell Movement
- Describe the components of the cytoskeleton
- Explain how the cytoskeleton supports cell structure and movement
- Identify the roles of cilia and flagella

## Study Tips

1. **Label diagrams** of plant and animal cells
2. **Create function cards** for each organelle
3. **Use analogies** (cell as factory, city, etc.)
4. **Compare cell types** in tables
5. **Trace protein pathways** through the endomembrane system
