<h1>Module 14: Biotechnology and Genomics</h1>
<h2>Comprehension &amp; Critical Thinking Questions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Toolbox</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <strong>Restriction Enzyme</strong>? How do "sticky ends" help connect two different pieces of DNA?</li>
<li>What is a <strong>Vector</strong> (e.g., a plasmid)? How is it used to get foreign DNA into a bacterium?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the three steps of PCR: <strong>Denaturation</strong>, <strong>Annealing</strong>, and <strong>Extension</strong>.</li>
<li>Why is PCR often called "Molecular photocopying"? Why is it useful at a crime scene with a tiny blood sample?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visualizing DNA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain how <strong>Gel Electrophoresis</strong> separates DNA fragments.</li>
<li>Do smaller fragments move faster or slower? Why? (Think about moving through a thick jungle).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Applying Biological Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Genetic Engineering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define <strong>Transgenic Organism</strong> (GMO).</li>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: You want to make bacteria that produce human insulin. Outline the steps you would take. (Cut gene, cut plasmid, glue together, insert into bacteria).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNA Fingerprinting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: You are looking at a DNA gel from a paternity test. The Child has bands at position A and B. The Mother has a band at A.</li>
<li>Does the Father <em>have</em> to have a band at B? Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Analyzing &amp; Evaluating</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gene Therapy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiate between <strong>Ex Vivo</strong> (cells treated outside body) and <strong>In Vivo</strong> (treated inside body) gene therapy.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong>: What are the biggest challenges in gene therapy? (Hint: Delivery and Immune response).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genomics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have sequenced the entire human genome. <strong>Analyze</strong>: Why does knowing the sequence of letters (A,C,T,G) not immediately tell us what every gene does? What is distinct about <strong>Functional Genomics</strong>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
