Module 14: Biotechnology and Genomics
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
The Toolbox
       What is a restriction enzyme? How do "sticky ends" facilitate ligation?
       What is a vector (e.g., plasmid)? How is it used to introduce foreign DNA into bacteria?

PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
       Describe the three steps of PCR: Denaturation, Annealing, Extension.
       Why is PCR called "molecular photocopying"? Why is it useful for forensics?

Visualizing DNA
       Explain how gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments.
       Do smaller fragments migrate faster or slower? Why?

Part 2: Application
Genetic Engineering
       Define transgenic organism (GMO).
       Outline the steps to produce insulin-secreting bacteria.

DNA Fingerprinting
       In a paternity test, a child has bands at positions A and B. The mother has band A.
       Must the biological father have band B? Explain.

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Gene Therapy
       Differentiate ex vivo (cells treated outside the body) and in vivo (treatment inside the body) gene therapy.
       What are the major challenges? (Delivery, immune response, targeting)

Genomics
       We have sequenced the human genome. Why doesn't knowing the sequence immediately reveal gene function?
       What is functional genomics?
