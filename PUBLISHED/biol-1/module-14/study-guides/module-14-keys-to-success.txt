Module 14: Biotechnology and Genomics
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Explain the function of restriction enzymes and DNA ligase in creating recombinant DNA.
Describe the steps and purpose of PCR and gel electrophoresis.
Evaluate the benefits and risks of transgenic organisms (GMOs).
Discuss the goals and methods of gene therapy.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Recombinant DNA: DNA containing genetic material from two different sources.
[ ] Plasmid: A small circular DNA molecule in bacteria, often used as a cloning vector.
[ ] DNA Ligase: An enzyme that seals breaks in the DNA backbone.
[ ] STR (Short Tandem Repeat): Highly variable DNA sequences used in genetic fingerprinting.
[ ] Bioinformatics: The use of computational tools to analyze biological data.

Concept Check
Molecular Cloning
   Question: What enzymes are used to create recombinant DNA?
   Key Answer:
       Restriction enzymes: Cut DNA at specific recognition sequences, generating sticky or blunt ends.
       DNA ligase: Joins DNA fragments together.

Gel Electrophoresis
   Question: How does gel electrophoresis separate DNA?
   Key Answer: DNA is negatively charged (phosphate groups). In an electric field, DNA migrates toward the positive electrode. Smaller fragments move faster/farther through the gel matrix.

Transgenic Organisms
   Question: What are applications of transgenic technology?
   Key Answer:
       Bacteria: Production of insulin, human growth hormone.
       Plants: Golden Rice (Vitamin A), pest-resistant crops.
    *   Animals: Pharmaceutical production in milk.
