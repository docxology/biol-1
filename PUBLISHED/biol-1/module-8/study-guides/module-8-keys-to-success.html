<h1>Module 8: Cellular Respiration</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Map</strong> the stages of cellular respiration to their locations in the cell.</li>
<li><strong>Calculate</strong> the inputs and outputs (ATP, NADH, FADH₂) for each stage.</li>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> the function of the Electron Transport Chain and chemiosmosis.</li>
<li><strong>Compare</strong> aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, and fermentation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <strong>Aerobic vs. Anaerobic</strong>: Requiring oxygen vs. not requiring oxygen.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Oxidation</strong>: Loss of electrons (glucose is oxidized during respiration).</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Reduction</strong>: Gain of electrons (oxygen is reduced to water).</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Chemiosmosis</strong>: ATP synthesis driven by the flow of H⁺ ions down their electrochemical gradient through ATP synthase.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>ATP Synthase</strong>: The enzyme complex that synthesizes ATP from ADP and Pᵢ.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Cristae</strong>: Inner mitochondrial membrane folds that increase surface area for the ETC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Electron Transport Chain</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the role of the ETC?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: The ETC transfers electrons through protein complexes, using the released energy to pump H⁺ ions across the inner membrane. The resulting proton gradient drives ATP synthesis via ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation).</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Oxygen's Role</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Why is oxygen essential for aerobic respiration?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the ETC. Without it, electrons cannot flow, the proton gradient collapses, and ATP production ceases. Oxygen is reduced to water.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Fermentation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Why do cells perform fermentation?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Fermentation regenerates NAD⁺ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue producing 2 ATP per glucose in the absence of oxygen. The carbon in pyruvate is converted to ethanol (yeast) or lactate (muscle) rather than fully oxidized.</li>
</ul>
