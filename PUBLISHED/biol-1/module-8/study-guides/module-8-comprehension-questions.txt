Module 8: Cellular Respiration
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
The Overview
       Write the balanced chemical equation for Cellular Respiration.
       Name the four main stages of aerobic respiration: Glycolysis, Prep Reaction, Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle, Electron Transport Chain.

Locations
       Where in the cell does Glycolysis occur?
       Where do the Citric Acid Cycle and ETC occur? (Be specific about mitochondrial compartments).

The Players
       What are chemico-osmosis and oxidative phosphorylation?
       What is the role of Oxygen? Why do we die without it? (Hint: It's the "Final Electron Acceptor").

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
Tracking the Math
       Start with one Glucose molecule.
       How many ATP are made in Glycolysis? (Net)
       How many ATP are made in Krebs?
       How many ATP are made in the ETC?
       Why is the "Total ATP" usually a range (30-32 or 36-38) rather than a fixed number?

Anaerobic Options
       If no Oxygen is available, cells switch to Fermentation.
       Compare Lactic Acid Fermentation (Humans/Bacteria) vs. Alcohol Fermentation (Yeast).
       Does fermentation produce any new ATP? If not, why do cells do it? (Hint: Regenerating NAD+).

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Efficiency Analysis
       Automobiles are about 25% efficient (converting gas to movement). Cellular respiration is about 34% efficient. Where does the rest of the energy go? (Refer back to thermodynamics/body heat).

Metabolic Crossroads
       We don't just eat sugar. Explain how proteins and fats enter the cellular respiration pathway. Where do fats enter? Where do amino acids enter? (Deamination).
