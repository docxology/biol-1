Module 8: Cellular Respiration
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
The Overview
       Write the balanced equation for cellular respiration: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP.
       Name the four stages: Glycolysis, Pyruvate Oxidation, Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle, Electron Transport Chain/Oxidative Phosphorylation.

Locations
       Where does glycolysis occur?
       Where do pyruvate oxidation, the Citric Acid Cycle, and the ETC occur? (Be specific about mitochondrial compartments.)

Key Concepts
       Define chemiosmosis and oxidative phosphorylation.
       What is the role of oxygen? Why is it called the "final electron acceptor"?

Part 2: Application
ATP Accounting
       Starting with one glucose molecule:
           Net ATP from glycolysis: 2
           ATP from Citric Acid Cycle: 2
           ATP from ETC/Oxidative Phosphorylation: 26-28
       Why is the total ATP yield a range (30-32) rather than a fixed number?

Anaerobic Options
       If oxygen is unavailable, cells perform fermentation.
       Compare lactic acid fermentation (animals, bacteria) and alcohol fermentation (yeast).
       Does fermentation produce new ATP? What is its primary purpose?

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Efficiency Analysis
       Cellular respiration captures approximately 34% of glucose's energy in ATP. Where does the remaining energy go? (Heat, entropy)

Metabolic Integration
       Proteins and fats can enter the respiratory pathway. Where do fatty acids enter? Where do amino acids enter after deamination?
