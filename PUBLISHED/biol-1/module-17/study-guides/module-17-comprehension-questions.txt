Module 17: Speciation and Macroevolution
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
Species Concepts
       Define the Biological Species Concept. What is the key criterion? (Reproduction).
       Why is this concept hard to apply to fossils or asexual bacteria? What is the Morphological Species Concept?

Reproductive Barriers
       Barriers prevent species from mixing. Classify the following as Pre-zygotic or Post-zygotic:
           Two birds reproduce at different times of year (Temporal).
           Sperm cannot fertilize egg (Gametic).
           Hybrid offspring is frail or sterile (Mule).

Modes of Speciation
       Compare Allopatric Speciation (Other Country) and Sympatric Speciation (Same Country).
       Which one requires a physical geographic barrier?

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
Adaptive Radiation
       Scenario: A few finches are blown to a volcanic archipelago (Galapagos) with many empty habitats.
       Apply: Explain how this single species can rapidly diverge into many new species.

Convergent Evolution
       Sharks (Fish) and Dolphins (Mammals) look very similar (Torpedo shape, fins).
       Apply: Did they inherit this shape from a common torpedo-ancestor, or did they evolve it independently? What environmental pressure caused this?

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Macroevolutionary Pacing
       Contrast Gradualism (Slow, steady change) with Punctuated Equilibrium (Long statis, sudden change).
       Which model is better supported by the fossil record? (Hint: It's often a mix, but Punctuated explains gaps well).

The Goal of Evolution
       Critique: "Evolution drives organisms to become perfect."
       Is evolution goal-oriented? Or does it just respond to the immediate environment? (Think about "Good enough" vs "Perfect").
