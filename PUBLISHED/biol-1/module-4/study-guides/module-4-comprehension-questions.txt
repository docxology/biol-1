Module 4: Cells
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
Cell Theory
       State the three fundamental tenets of Cell Theory.
       Why is the cell considered the basic unit of life?

Cell Types
       Create a Venn Diagram comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells.
       Which domains of life are Prokaryotic? Which are Eukaryotic?

The Endomembrane System
       Trace the path of a protein from its production to its export from the cell. In your answer, include the roles of: Nucleus, Ribosome, Rough ER, Transport Vesicle, Golgi Apparatus, and Cell Membrane.

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
Organelle Function
       Analogy: If a cell were a factory, what "job" corresponds to each organelle?
           Mitochondria (Power Plant?)
           Lysosome (Recycling Center?)
           Nucleus (CEO?)
       Explain the biological justification for each analogy.

Plant vs. Animal Cells
       You are looking at a cell under a microscope. You see a rigid cell wall and green variety of organelles. Is this a plant or animal cell? Explain.
       Why do plants need a Central Vacuole while animals generally do not?

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Surface Area to Volume Ratio
       Why are cells microscopic? Analyze what happens to a cell's ability to transport nutrients and waste as it gets larger. (Hint: Volume increases faster than Surface Area).

Origins of Complexity
       Explain the Endosymbiotic Theory. What evidence suggests that Mitochondria and Chloroplasts were once independent bacterial cells? (Think about their DNA and membranes).
