<h1>Module 4: Cells</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Differentiate</strong> between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on structure and complexity.
2.  <strong>Identify</strong> and describe the function of major eukaryotic organelles.
3.  <strong>Trace</strong> the production and transport of cellular products through the endomembrane system.
4.  <strong>Explain</strong> the Endosymbiotic Theory regarding the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Cytoplasm</strong>: The jelly-like fluid filing the cell.
- [ ] <strong>Plasma Membrane</strong>: The boundary of the cell.
- [ ] <strong>Organelle</strong>: "Little organ"; specialized structure within a cell.
- [ ] <strong>Ribosome</strong>: The site of protein synthesis.
- [ ] <strong>Cytoskeleton</strong>: Network of fibers (microtubules, microfilaments) holding the cell together.
- [ ] <strong>ATP</strong>: The energy currency generated by mitochondria.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Limits of Size</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Why do cells have to be as small as they are?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Imagine a cell is a balloon. As you blow it up, the inside (volume) grows huge, but the rubber skin (surface area) stretches thin. If the membrane is the "mouth" of the cell, can a tiny mouth feed a giant body?</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Prokaryote Simplicity</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: In what major way do prokaryotic cells differ from eukaryotic cells?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Prokaryotes lack a nucleus. Where is their DNA kept? (The Nucleoid region). They are simple, but successful—are there more bacteria on Earth or humans?</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Powering the Cell</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the role of mitochondria in a cell?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Mitochondria perform <strong>Cellular Respiration</strong>. They use Oxygen and Sugar to make ATP. Which cells in your body would need the <em>most</em> mitochondria? (Muscle cells? Brain cells? Why?).</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Clean Up Crew</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What do lysosomes do?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes. What happens if a lysosome bursts <em>inside</em> the cell? (This is actually a mechanism for programmed cell death, or Apoptosis).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cell City</strong>: Do not just memorize the list of organelles. Assign them a job in a city or a factory. It makes the abstract functions concrete.</li>
<li><strong>Draw two cells</strong>: Draw a Plant Cell and an Animal Cell side-by-side.<ul>
<li>Highlight the differences (Wall, Chloroplast, Vacuole).</li>
<li>Review the shared structures (Nucleus, Mitochondria, ER).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prefixes</strong>:<ul>
<li><em>Cyto-</em> = Cell.</li>
<li><em>Pro-</em> = Before.</li>
<li><em>Eu-</em> = True.</li>
<li><em>Kary-</em> = Nucleus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
