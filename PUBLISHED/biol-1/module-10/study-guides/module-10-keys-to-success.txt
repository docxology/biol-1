Module 10: Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Contrast the outcomes of Asexual and Sexual reproduction.
Distinguish between Homologous Chromosomes and Sister Chromatids.
Diagram the phases of Meiosis I and II.
Explain the three sources of genetic variation: Crossing Over, Independent Assortment, and Random Fertilization.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.
[ ] Allele: Alternative forms of a gene (e.g., Blue eye gene vs. Brown eye gene).
[ ] Karyotype: A visual display of an individual's chromosomes arranged in pairs.
[ ] Synapsis: The fussing of homologous chromosomes during Prophase I.
[ ] Tetrad: The structure formed by two homologous chromosomes (4 chromatids).
[ ] Euploidy: The correct number of chromosomes.
[ ] Aneuploidy: An abnormal number of chromosomes (+1 or -1).

Concept Check
The Reductive Division
   Question: What separates during meiosis I? Meiosis II?
   Deep Dive: This is the most common exam mistake.
       Meiosis I: Homologous Pairs separate from each other. (Diploid -> Haploid).
       Meiosis II: Sister Chromatids separate. (Haploid -> Haploid).

The Variation Machine
   Question: Why is genetic variation so important?
   Deep Dive: Variation is the raw material for adaptation. If a population is identical (clones) and a new disease arrives, it kills everyone. If there is variation, some might survive.

Counting Chromosomes
   Question: How many chromosomes do humans have?
   Deep Dive: 46 total.
       22 Pairs of Autosomes (Instructions for body).
       1 Pair of Sex Chromosomes (XX or XY).
       Gametes (Sperm/Egg) have 23 total chromosomes (no pairs).

Errors
   Question: What is a nondisjunction?
   Deep Dive: Failure to separate. It leads to gametes with n+1 or n-1 chromosomes.
       n+1 sperm + n egg = 2n+1 (Trisomy).
       n-1 sperm + n egg = 2n-1 (Monosomy).

Study Tips
   Dance of the Chromosomes:
       Imagine two pairs of shoes (Dad's boots, Mom's heels).
       Replication: Photocopy each shoe. Now you have two boots tied together (Sisters) and two heels tied together (Sisters).
       Metaphase I: The Boots pair up with the Heels. (Homologous pair).
       Anaphase I: Boots go left, Heels go right.
       Metaphase II: The tie snaps. Single shoes separate.
   Focus on Prophase I: This is where the magic happens (Crossing Over). It's the longest phase.
