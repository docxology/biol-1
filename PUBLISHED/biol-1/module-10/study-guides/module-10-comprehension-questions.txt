Module 10: Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
Sexual Reproduction Basics
       Define Gametes and Zygotes.
       Why must gametes be Haploid (n) while body cells are Diploid (2n)? What would happen to the chromosome number in the offspring if gametes were diploid?

Meiosis Phases
       Meiosis involves two rounds of division (Meiosis I and II). What is being separated in Anaphase I? (Homologous Pairs).
       What is being separated in Anaphase II? (Sister Chromatids).

Key Events
       Describe Crossing Over (Synapsis). When does it happen? Why is it crucial for evolution?
       Describe Independent Assortment. How does the random alignment of chromosomes create unique gametes?

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
Mitosis vs. Meiosis
       Create a comparison table:
           End Product: (2 Identical cells vs 4 Unique cells).
           Purpose: (Growth/Repair vs Reproduction).
           Divisions: (1 vs 2).

Human Genetics
       Humans have 46 chromosomes.
           How many pairs are Autosomes?
           How many pairs are Sex Chromosomes?
       What determines biological maleness in humans? (The Y chromosome).

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
When Things Go Wrong
       Define Nondisjunction.
       Analyze: If a Nondisjunction event happens in Meiosis I, how many gametes will be abnormal? What if it happens in Meiosis II?
       Explain the genetic cause of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21).

The Cost of Sex
       Asexual reproduction is fast and efficient. Sexual reproduction is slow and costly (finding a mate). Evaluate: Why is sexual reproduction so common? What is the biological payoff? (Answer: Genetic Diversity).
