<h1>Module 12: Gene Expression (DNA to Protein)</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Describe</strong> the chemical structure of DNA and specific base-pairing rules.
2.  <strong>Explain</strong> the semi-conservative model of DNA replication.
3.  <strong>Transcribe</strong> a DNA sequence into mRNA and <strong>Translate</strong> it into a polypeptide.
4.  <strong>Differentiate</strong> between the functions of mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Nucleotide</strong>: Sugar + Phosphate + Nitrogen Base.
- [ ] <strong>Purine vs. Pyrimidine</strong>: Double ring (A, G) vs Single ring (C, T, U).
- [ ] <strong>Codon</strong>: A 3-letter "word" in mRNA that codes for one amino acid.
- [ ] <strong>Anticodon</strong>: The matching 3-letter sequence on tRNA.
- [ ] <strong>Promoter</strong>: The "Start Here" signal on DNA for transcription.
- [ ] <strong>Helicase</strong>: The enzyme that "unzips" the genes.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Blueprint</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: DNA is antiparallel. What does this mean?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: One strand runs 5' -&gt; 3', the other runs 3' -&gt; 5'. It's like a two-way street. Enzymes can usually only drive in one direction (5' -&gt; 3'), which makes replication complicated on the backward strand.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Reading the Code</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How many codons are there?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: There are 64 possible codons (4x4x4), but only 20 amino acids. This means the code is <strong>Redundant</strong> (multiple codons mean the same thing). Why is this a safety feature against mutation?</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. The Editors</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How are transcripts processed in eukaryotes?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Pre-mRNA has junk in it (<strong>Introns</strong>). The cell splices them out and keeps the good parts (<strong>Exons</strong>). It's like editing raw film footage to make the final movie.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A-T / G-C</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>pples in the <strong>T</strong>ree.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>ars in the <strong>G</strong>arage.</li>
<li><em>(Remember: In RNA, Apple goes Under (Uracil) the tree).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>3 Types of RNA</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>mRNA</strong> (Messenger): The script/recipe.</li>
<li><strong>tRNA</strong> (Transfer): The truck bringing ingredients (amino acids).</li>
<li><strong>rRNA</strong> (Ribosomal): The kitchen/factory where it happens.</li>
</ul>
