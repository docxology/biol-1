Module 12: Gene Expression (DNA to Protein)
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Describe the chemical structure of DNA and the rules of complementary base pairing.
Explain the semi-conservative model of DNA replication.
Transcribe a DNA sequence into mRNA and translate it into a polypeptide.
Differentiate between the functions of mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Nucleotide: The monomer of nucleic acids (sugar + phosphate + nitrogenous base).
[ ] Purine vs. Pyrimidine: Double-ring bases (A, G) vs. single-ring bases (C, T, U).
[ ] Codon: A three-nucleotide sequence in mRNA that specifies an amino acid.
[ ] Anticodon: The complementary three-nucleotide sequence on tRNA.
[ ] Promoter: A DNA sequence where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.
[ ] Helicase: The enzyme that unwinds the DNA double helix.

Concept Check
DNA Structure
   Question: What does "antiparallel" mean in DNA?
   Key Answer: The two DNA strands run in opposite directions: one 5′→3′, the other 3′→5′. This orientation affects replication (leading vs. lagging strand).

The Genetic Code
   Question: How many codons exist?
   Key Answer: 64 codons (4³), but only 20 amino acids. The code is degenerate (redundant)—multiple codons specify the same amino acid, providing a buffer against point mutations.

RNA Processing
   Question: How is pre-mRNA processed in eukaryotes?
   Key Answer: Introns (non-coding) are spliced out; exons (coding) are joined. A 5′ cap and poly-A tail are added for stability and export.
