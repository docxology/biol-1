Module 11: Mendelian Genetics
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Predict the outcomes of monohybrid and dihybrid crosses using Punnett Squares.
Differentiate between dominant, recessive, incomplete dominance, and codominance.
Analyze pedigrees to determine inheritance patterns (autosomal vs. sex-linked).
Explain how multiple alleles and polygenic inheritance produce phenotypic variation.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Locus: The specific position of a gene on a chromosome.
[ ] True-Breeding: An organism homozygous for a trait that always produces offspring with the same phenotype.
[ ] F₁ Generation: The first filial generation (offspring of P₀ cross).
[ ] Carrier: A heterozygous individual who possesses a recessive allele but does not express the trait.
[ ] Pleiotropy: A single gene affecting multiple phenotypic traits.

Concept Check
Monohybrid Ratios
   Question: What phenotypic ratio results from a monohybrid cross between two heterozygotes?
   Key Answer: 3:1 (3 dominant phenotype : 1 recessive phenotype). Genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa).

Dihybrid Ratios
   Question: What phenotypic ratio results from a dihybrid cross (AaBb × AaBb)?
   Key Answer: 9:3:3:1 (9 AB : 3 Abb : 3 aaB : 1 aabb).

Sex-Linked Inheritance
   Question: Why are males more frequently affected by sex-linked recessive disorders?
   Key Answer: Males are hemizygous (XY)—they have only one X chromosome. A single recessive allele on the X will be expressed. Females (XX) require two copies for expression.
