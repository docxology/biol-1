Module 11: Mendelian Genetics
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Predict the outcomes of monohybrid and dihybrid crosses using Punnett Squares.
Differentiate between dominant, recessive, incomplete dominant, and codominant traits.
Analyze pedigrees to determine inheritance patterns (Autosomal vs Sex-linked).
Explain how multiple alleles and polygenic traits result in non-binary phenotypes.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.
[ ] Locus: The specific physical location of a gene on a chromosome.
[ ] True-Breeding: An organism that always passes down certain phenotypic traits (Always Homozygous).
[ ] F1 Generation: The first filial generation (offspring of the parents).
[ ] Carrier: An individual who has a recessive allele for a disease but does not show symptoms (Heterozygote).
[ ] Pleiotropy: One gene affecting multiple seemingly unrelated traits (e.g., Marfan Syndrome).

Concept Check
The Ratios
   Question: What would be the resultant phenotype ratio for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygotes?
   Deep Dive: The Golden Ratio of Genetics is 3:1.
       AA (Dom)
       Aa (Dom)
       Aa (Dom)
       aa (Rec)
       3 Dominant phenotypes : 1 Recessive phenotype.

Dihybrid Madness
   Question: What is the ratio for a dihybrid cross (AaBb x AaBb)?
   Deep Dive: 9:3:3:1.
       9 Dom/Dom
       3 Dom/Rec
       3 Rec/Dom
       1 Rec/Rec.

Sex-Linked traits
   Question: Do males or females get sex-linked disease more?
   Deep Dive: Males. Why? Because males are XY. If they get a bad gene on their single X, they have no backup. Females are XX, so a healthy X can mask a bad one (making them a Carrier).

Study Tips
   Letter Logic: Always use the letter of the Dominant trait. If Tall is dominant, use T/t. Don't use S for short. It gets confusing.
   The "And" Rule: If you want the probability of This AND That happen (e.g., Tall AND Purple), multiply the individual probabilities.
       Prob(Tall) = 3/4.
       Prob(Purple) = 3/4.
       Prob(Tall and Purple) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.
