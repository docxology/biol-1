Module 11: Mendelian Genetics
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
Mendel's Laws
       Define the Law of Segregation. (Hint: How many alleles for a trait does a gamete receive?).
       Define the Law of Independent Assortment. (Hint: Do hair color genes affect eye color genes?).

Genotype vs. Phenotype
       Explain the difference between Homozygous Dominant (AA), Heterozygous (Aa), and Homozygous Recessive (aa).
       If "A" is Tall and "a" is Short, what is the phenotype of "Aa"?

Complex Patterns
       Differentiate between Incomplete Dominance (Red x White = Pink) and Codominance (Red x White = Red & White Spots).
       Explain Polygenic Inheritance using human skin color or height as an example.

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
The Monohybrid Cross
       Scenario: In peas, Purple flowers (P) are dominant to White flowers (p).
       Apply: Perform a cross between two Heterozygotes (Pp x Pp). What is the expected Genotypic ratio? What is the expected Phenotypic ratio?

Blood Typing
       Human blood type is determined by multiple alleles (IA, IB, i).
       Apply: Can a mother with Type A blood and a father with Type B blood have a Type O child? Show the Punnett square.

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Pedigree Analysis
       You are tracing a disease in a family tree. Two healthy parents have an affected child. Is the disease likely Dominant or Recessive? Explain your logic.

Nature vs. Nurture
       Hydrangea flowers change color based on soil pH. Analyzing this in the context of genetics: Does Genotype always strictly determine Phenotype? How does the environment modify gene expression?
