Module 11: Mendelian Genetics
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
Mendel's Laws
       Define the Law of Segregation.
       Define the Law of Independent Assortment. Does the inheritance of one trait affect another?

Genotype vs. Phenotype
       Explain the difference between homozygous dominant (AA), heterozygous (Aa), and homozygous recessive (aa).
       If "A" = Tall and "a" = Short, what is the phenotype of "Aa"?

Complex Patterns
       Differentiate between incomplete dominance and codominance.
       Explain polygenic inheritance using human height or skin color as an example.

Part 2: Application
Monohybrid Cross
       In peas, Purple flowers (P) are dominant to White flowers (p).
       Perform a cross: Pp × Pp. What are the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios?

Blood Typing
       Human blood type involves multiple alleles (Iᴬ, Iᴮ, i) and codominance.
       Can a Type A mother and Type B father have a Type O child? Show the Punnett square.

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Pedigree Analysis
       Two unaffected parents have an affected child. Is the trait likely dominant or recessive?

Nature vs. Nurture
       Hydrangea flower color changes with soil pH. Does genotype always strictly determine phenotype? How does the environment modify gene expression?
