Module 1: Biology - The Study of Life
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Identify and explain the six fundamental characteristics shared by all living organisms.
Order the levels of biological organization from atom to biosphere.
Differentiate between the three domains of life and the kingdoms within Eukarya.
Apply the scientific method to hypothetical scenarios, distinguishing between hypothesis, theory, and law.
Explain the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients in various ecosystems.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.
[ ] Homeostasis: Maintenance of stable internal conditions.
[ ] Metabolism: All chemical reactions involved in maintaining the living state of the cells and the organism.
[ ] Binomial Nomenclature: The two-part naming system (Genus species).
[ ] Prokaryote vs. Eukaryote: Cells without a nucleus vs. cells with a nucleus.
[ ] Autotroph vs. Heterotroph: Self-feeders vs. other-feeders.
[ ] Natural Selection: The process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring.

Concept Check
The Nature of Life
   Question: What are the 6 characteristics of life?
   Deep Dive: If you found a mysterious slime on a rock, what tests would you run to determine if it is "alive" according to biological standards? (Think: reproduction, energy use, response to stimuli, etc.)

The Hierarchy of Life
   Question: What are the levels of biological organization?
   Deep Dive: How does a Community differ from an Ecosystem? (Hint: Does one include non-living factors like rain and rocks?)

Energy & Evolution
   Question: How can deer shape the natural selection of plant leaves?
   Deep Dive: This is an example of an evolutionary pressure. Explain how the deer acting as a predator causes the plant population to change over generations. Is this change intentional by the plant?

The Science of Biology
   Question: What is the difference between a scientific theory and a scientific law?
   Deep Dive: A Law predicts what happens (descriptive). A Theory proposes why it happens (explanatory). Gravity is a law (things fall). Gravity is also a theory (curvature of spacetime). In Biology, Evolution is a Theory because it provides a comprehensive explanation for the diversity of life, supported by massive evidence.

Study Tips
   Mnemonics work! Create a sentence to remember the classification order (Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).
       Example: "Dear King Philip Came Over For Good Soup."
   Visualize the Ladder: When studying biological organization, draw it out as a ladder or a pyramid. Visuals help cement the hierarchy better than lists.
   Latin Roots: Many biological terms come from Latin/Greek.
       Bio = Life
       Logy = Study of
       Homeo = Same/Steady
       Stasis = State
