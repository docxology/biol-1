<h1>Module 1: Biology - The Study of Life</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Identify</strong> and explain the six fundamental characteristics shared by all living organisms.
2.  <strong>Order</strong> the levels of biological organization from atom to biosphere.
3.  <strong>Differentiate</strong> between the three domains of life and the kingdoms within Eukarya.
4.  <strong>Apply</strong> the scientific method to hypothetical scenarios, distinguishing between hypothesis, theory, and law.
5.  <strong>Explain</strong> the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients in various ecosystems.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Homeostasis</strong>: Maintenance of stable internal conditions.
- [ ] <strong>Metabolism</strong>: All chemical reactions involved in maintaining the living state of the cells and the organism.
- [ ] <strong>Binomial Nomenclature</strong>: The two-part naming system (Genus species).
- [ ] <strong>Prokaryote vs. Eukaryote</strong>: Cells without a nucleus vs. cells with a nucleus.
- [ ] <strong>Autotroph vs. Heterotroph</strong>: Self-feeders vs. other-feeders.
- [ ] <strong>Natural Selection</strong>: The process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Nature of Life</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the 6 characteristics of life?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: If you found a mysterious slime on a rock, what tests would you run to determine if it is "alive" according to biological standards? (Think: reproduction, energy use, response to stimuli, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. The Hierarchy of Life</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the levels of biological organization?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: How does a <strong>Community</strong> differ from an <strong>Ecosystem</strong>? (Hint: Does one include non-living factors like rain and rocks?)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Energy &amp; Evolution</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How can deer shape the natural selection of plant leaves?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: This is an example of an evolutionary pressure. Explain how the deer acting as a predator causes the plant population to change over generations. Is this change intentional by the plant?</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. The Science of Biology</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the difference between a scientific theory and a scientific law?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: A <strong>Law</strong> predicts <em>what</em> happens (descriptive). A <strong>Theory</strong> proposes <em>why</em> it happens (explanatory). Gravity is a law (things fall). Gravity is also a theory (curvature of spacetime). In Biology, Evolution is a <strong>Theory</strong> because it provides a comprehensive explanation for the diversity of life, supported by massive evidence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mnemonics work!</strong> Create a sentence to remember the classification order (Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: "Dear King Philip Came Over For Good Soup."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Visualize the Ladder</strong>: When studying biological organization, draw it out as a ladder or a pyramid. Visuals help cement the hierarchy better than lists.</li>
<li><strong>Latin Roots</strong>: Many biological terms come from Latin/Greek.<ul>
<li><em>Bio</em> = Life</li>
<li><em>Logy</em> = Study of</li>
<li><em>Homeo</em> = Same/Steady</li>
<li><em>Stasis</em> = State</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
