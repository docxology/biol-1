<h1>Module 1: Biology - The Study of Life</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify</strong> and explain the seven fundamental characteristics shared by all living organisms.</li>
<li><strong>Order</strong> the levels of biological organization from atom to biosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiate</strong> between the three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya) and the kingdoms within Eukarya.</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong> the scientific method to hypothetical scenarios, distinguishing between hypothesis, theory, and law.</li>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients in ecosystems.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <strong>Homeostasis</strong>: The maintenance of stable internal conditions despite external changes.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Metabolism</strong>: The sum of all chemical reactions in an organism, including anabolism (building) and catabolism (breaking down).</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Binomial Nomenclature</strong>: The two-part naming system for species (<em>Genus species</em>).</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Prokaryote vs. Eukaryote</strong>: Cells lacking a membrane-bound nucleus vs. cells with a true nucleus.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Autotroph vs. Heterotroph</strong>: Organisms that produce their own food vs. organisms that consume others.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Natural Selection</strong>: The differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to heritable variation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Characteristics of Life</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the 7 characteristics shared by all living organisms?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Organization, metabolism, homeostasis, growth and development, reproduction, response to stimuli, and evolution/adaptation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. The Hierarchy of Life</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the levels of biological organization, from smallest to largest?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Atom → Molecule → Organelle → Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ System → Organism → Population → Community → Ecosystem → Biosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Distinction</strong>: A <strong>Community</strong> includes only the living organisms in an area, while an <strong>Ecosystem</strong> includes both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) factors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Energy Flow and Nutrient Cycling</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How does energy flow through an ecosystem differ from nutrient cycling?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Energy flows one-way (Sun → Producers → Consumers → Heat). Nutrients cycle (Carbon, Nitrogen move between organisms and environment repeatedly).</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. The Science of Biology</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the difference between a scientific theory and a scientific law?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: A <strong>Law</strong> describes <em>what</em> happens under certain conditions (e.g., Law of Gravity). A <strong>Theory</strong> explains <em>why</em> phenomena occur, supported by extensive evidence (e.g., Theory of Evolution). Theories do not become laws; they serve different purposes.</li>
</ul>
