Module 1: Biology - The Study of Life
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
The Characteristics of Life
       List the seven characteristics shared by all living things.
       Select a specific organism (e.g., E. coli, a sunflower, a wolf) and explain how it demonstrates each characteristic.

Levels of Organization
       Define each level of biological organization: Atom, Molecule, Organelle, Cell, Tissue, Organ, Organ System, Organism, Population, Community, Ecosystem, Biosphere.
       Which level is considered the fundamental unit of life? Justify your answer.

Classification Systems
       What is the primary purpose of biological classification (taxonomy)?
       List the eight taxonomic ranks from most inclusive to most specific: Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.
       Explain the rules of Binomial Nomenclature. Why do scientists use scientific names rather than common names?

The Scientific Method
       Outline the steps of the scientific method.
       Define homeostasis and provide a biological example.

Part 2: Application
Energy Dynamics
       Contrast how autotrophs and heterotrophs acquire energy.
       Diagram the one-way flow of energy through an ecosystem versus the cyclic flow of nutrients.

Evolutionary Pressures
       Scenario: A beetle population contains green and brown individuals. Birds preferentially prey on the beetles.
       Apply: Predict how the presence of birds might shape the beetle population over generations if the environment is predominantly brown leaves.

Scientific Inquiry
       Scenario: You observe that cellular phones lose battery faster in cold temperatures.
       Design: A controlled experiment including your observation, hypothesis, independent variable, dependent variable, and control group.

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Structure and Function
       "Structure determines function" is a unifying theme in biology. Analyze this principle at the cellular level (e.g., red blood cells) and the organ level (e.g., the heart).

Theory vs. Law
       Compare and contrast a scientific theory (e.g., Theory of Evolution) with a scientific law (e.g., Law of Thermodynamics). Which explains why phenomena occur?

The Three Domains
       Compare the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
    *   Critique the statement: "All bacteria are harmful." Use evidence from biological diversity.
