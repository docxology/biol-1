<h1>Module 1: Biology - The Study of Life</h1>
<h2>Comprehension &amp; Critical Thinking Questions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Characteristics of Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>List the six shared characteristics of all living things.</li>
<li>Select one specific organism (e.g., a sunflower, a wolf, a bacteria) and briefly explain how it demonstrates <em>each</em> of the six characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Levels of Organization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define the hierarchy of biological organization from specific to general: <em>Atom, Molecule, Cell, Tissue, Organ, Organ System, Organism, Population, Community, Ecosystem, Biosphere</em>.</li>
<li>Which level is considered the fundamental unit of life? Why?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Classification Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the primary purpose of biological classification (taxonomy)?</li>
<li>List the eight levels of classification in order from most inclusive (Domain) to most specific (Species).</li>
<li>Explain the rules of <strong>Binomial Nomenclature</strong>. Why is it important for scientists to use scientific names (e.g., <em>Homo sapiens</em>) rather than common names?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Scientific Method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Outline the standard sequence of the scientific process.</li>
<li>Define <strong>Homeostasis</strong> and give one biological example of it in action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Applying Biological Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Dynamics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All life requires energy. Contrast how <strong>Autotrophs</strong> (producers) and <strong>Heterotrophs</strong> (consumers) acquire this energy.</li>
<li>Construct a simple flow chart showing how energy moves through an ecosystem (starting from the sun) versus how nutrients cycle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolutionary Pressures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A population of beetles lives in a forest with green and brown leaves. Some beetles are green, and some are brown. Birds love to eat these beetles.</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong>: How might the presence of the birds (predators) shape the natural selection of the beetles over time? Which beetles are likely to survive and reproduce?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scientific Inquiry in Action</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: You observe that cellular phones seem to lose battery faster in the cold.</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong>: Design a simple controlled experiment to test this. Identify your <strong>Observation</strong>, <strong>Hypothesis</strong>, <strong>Independent Variable</strong> (what you change), and <strong>Dependent Variable</strong> (what you measure).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Analyzing &amp; Evaluating</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Structure and Function</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Structure determines function" is a unifying theme in biology. Analyze how this principle applies at the <strong>cellular level</strong> (e.g., red blood cells) versus the <strong>organ level</strong> (e.g., the heart). How does the shape support the job?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Theory vs. Law</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In common language, "theory" often means a guess. In science, it means something very different. Compare and contrast a <strong>Scientific Theory</strong> (e.g., Evolutionary Theory) with a <strong>Scientific Law</strong> (e.g., Law of Gravity). Which one explains <em>why</em> distinct biological phenomena happen?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Three Domains</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compare the three domains of life: <strong>Bacteria</strong>, <strong>Archaea</strong>, and <strong>Eukarya</strong>.</li>
<li>Critique the statement: "All bacteria are harmful germs." Use your knowledge of the domains and biological diversity to support or refute this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
