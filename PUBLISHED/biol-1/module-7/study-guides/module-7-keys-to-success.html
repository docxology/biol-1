<h1>Module 7: Photosynthesis</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Trace</strong> the flow of energy from sunlight to chemical bonds in glucose.
2.  <strong>Locate</strong> the specific reactions of photosynthesis within the chloroplast structure.
3.  <strong>Explain</strong> the inputs and outputs of the Light Reactions and the Calvin Cycle.
4.  <strong>Differentiate</strong> between C3, C4, and CAM photosynthetic strategies.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Photon</strong>: A particle of light.
- [ ] <strong>Stomata</strong>: Pores in the leaf for gas exchange (CO2 in, O2 out).
- [ ] <strong>Carbon Fixation</strong>: Converting inorganic CO2 into organic molecules.
- [ ] <strong>NADP+ / NADPH</strong>: The electron carrier shuttle.
- [ ] <strong>G3P</strong>: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, the direct product of the Calvin Cycle (precursor to glucose).</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Split</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the product of photosystem II and what is the mechanism for creating it?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: This is arguably the most important reaction for animal life. Water (H2O) is split. The electrons feed the photosytem, the H+ helps make ATP, and the O2 is released for us to breathe.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Fixing Gas</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What does it mean to fix a gas?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: It means taking a gas (CO2) which floats around and attaching it to a solid organic molecule so it becomes part of the plant's "body." Rubisco is the enzyme that does the fixing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Different Strokes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What environmental pressures led to CAM/C4 evolution?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: <strong>C3</strong> plants (normal) struggle in heat because RuBisCO accidentally grabs Oxygen instead of CO2 (Photorespiration).<ul>
<li><strong>C4</strong>: Separates capture and fixation by <em>Space</em> (different cells).</li>
<li><strong>CAM</strong>: Separates capture and fixation by <em>Time</em> (open pores at night, fix largely during day).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow the Carbon</strong>:<ul>
<li>In: CO2 (Air)</li>
<li>Process: Calvin Cycle (Stroma)</li>
<li>Out: Sugar (Food)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Follow the Energy</strong>:<ul>
<li>In: Light (Sun)</li>
<li>Process: Light Reactions (Thylakoid)</li>
<li>Intermediate: ATP/NADPH</li>
<li>End: Chemical bonds in Sugar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Compare</strong>: Make a T-Chart comparing Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration. Notice how they are almost exact opposites?</li>
