Module 7: Photosynthesis
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
The Big Picture
       Write the balanced equation for photosynthesis: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂.
       Identify which molecule is reduced (CO₂ → glucose) and which is oxidized (H₂O → O₂).

Chloroplast Anatomy
       Define thylakoid, granum, and stroma.
       Where do the Light Reactions occur? Where does the Calvin Cycle occur?

Pigments
       Why are most plants green? Explain in terms of light absorption and reflection.
       What is the role of the antenna complex in photosystems?

Part 2: Application
The Light Reactions
       Trace the path of an electron from water to NADPH.
       Why is water split at Photosystem II? What byproduct is released?
       How is ATP generated? (Chemiosmosis driven by H⁺ gradient)

The Calvin Cycle
       The Calvin Cycle produces G3P from CO₂. What two products from the Light Reactions are required?
       What is RuBisCO, and why is it considered the most abundant and important enzyme on Earth?

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Evolutionary Adaptations
       In hot, dry climates, stomatal closure leads to photorespiration. Analyze how C₄ and CAM plants solve this problem.
       Compare corn (C₄) and cactus (CAM) in terms of spatial vs. temporal separation of carbon fixation.

Global Impact
       Photosynthesis removed CO₂ and added O₂ to Earth's early atmosphere. Analyze how this enabled the evolution of aerobic respiration.
