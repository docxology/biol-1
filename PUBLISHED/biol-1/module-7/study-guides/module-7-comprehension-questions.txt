Module 7: Photosynthesis
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
The Big Picture
       Write the balanced chemical equation for Photosynthesis. Identify which reactant is "reduced" to make sugar and which is "oxidized" to make oxygen.
       Compare Autotrophs (producers) and Heterotrophs (consumers).

Anatomy of a Chloroplast
       Define Thylakoid, Granum, and Stroma.
       Where exactly do the Light Reactions take place? Where does the Calvin Cycle take place?

Pigments
       Why are plants green? Explain in terms of absorption and reflection of light wavelengths.
       What is the role of an Antenna Complex in a photosystem?

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
The Light Reactions
       Trace the path of an electron from Water to NADPH.
       Crucial Concept: Why is water split (Photolysis) at Photosystem II? What waste product is produced?
       How is ATP generated during the light reactions? (Hint: Proton gradient).

The Calvin Cycle (Dark Reactions)
       The Calvin Cycle builds sugar (G3P) from CO2. What two energy molecules from the Light Reactions are required to power this?
       What is Rubisco and why is it possibly the most important protein on Earth?

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Evolutionary Adaptations
       In hot, dry climates, plants must close their stomata to save water, which leads to photorespiration (wasteful). Analyze how C4 and CAM plants solve this problem.
       Compare: Corn (C4) vs. a Cactus (CAM). How do they differ in when or where they fix carbon?

Global Impact
       Photosynthesis removed massive amounts of CO2 from the ancient atmosphere and filled it with O2. Analyze how this event shaped the evolution of life (i.e., aerobic respiration).
