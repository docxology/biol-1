<h1>Module 7: Photosynthesis</h1>
<h2>Comprehension &amp; Critical Thinking Questions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write the balanced chemical equation for Photosynthesis. Identify which reactant is "reduced" to make sugar and which is "oxidized" to make oxygen.</li>
<li>Compare <strong>Autotrophs</strong> (producers) and <strong>Heterotrophs</strong> (consumers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anatomy of a Chloroplast</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define <strong>Thylakoid</strong>, <strong>Granum</strong>, and <strong>Stroma</strong>.</li>
<li>Where exactly do the Light Reactions take place? Where does the Calvin Cycle take place?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pigments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why are plants green? Explain in terms of absorption and reflection of light wavelengths.</li>
<li>What is the role of an <strong>Antenna Complex</strong> in a photosystem?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Applying Biological Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Light Reactions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trace the path of an electron from Water to NADPH.</li>
<li><strong>Crucial Concept</strong>: Why is water split (Photolysis) at Photosystem II? What waste product is produced?</li>
<li>How is ATP generated during the light reactions? (Hint: Proton gradient).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Calvin Cycle (Dark Reactions)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Calvin Cycle builds sugar (G3P) from CO2. What two energy molecules from the Light Reactions are required to power this?</li>
<li>What is <strong>Rubisco</strong> and why is it possibly the most important protein on Earth?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Analyzing &amp; Evaluating</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolutionary Adaptations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In hot, dry climates, plants must close their stomata to save water, which leads to photorespiration (wasteful). Analyze how <strong>C4</strong> and <strong>CAM</strong> plants solve this problem.</li>
<li><strong>Compare</strong>: Corn (C4) vs. a Cactus (CAM). How do they differ in <em>when</em> or <em>where</em> they fix carbon?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Photosynthesis removed massive amounts of CO2 from the ancient atmosphere and filled it with O2. Analyze how this event shaped the evolution of life (i.e., aerobic respiration).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
