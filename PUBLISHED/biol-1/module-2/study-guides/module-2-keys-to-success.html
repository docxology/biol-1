<h1>Module 2: Basic Chemistry</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Describe</strong> the structure of an atom and the properties of its subatomic particles.</li>
<li><strong>Compare</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong> ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> the unique life-supporting properties of water resulting from its polarity.</li>
<li><strong>Interpret</strong> the pH scale and explain the importance of buffers in maintaining homeostasis.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <strong>Matter</strong>: Anything that has mass and occupies space.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Isotope</strong>: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Valence Shell</strong>: The outermost electron shell, which determines an atom's reactivity.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Cation vs. Anion</strong>: A positively charged ion (lost electrons) vs. a negatively charged ion (gained electrons).</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Electronegativity</strong>: A measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a bond.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Solute vs. Solvent</strong>: The substance being dissolved vs. the dissolving medium.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic</strong>: Water-attracting vs. water-repelling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. Atomic Structure</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How are Atomic Number and Mass Number determined?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Atomic Number = number of protons (defines the element). Mass Number = protons + neutrons.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Carbon-14 (an isotope) has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Chemical Bonding</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How do ionic and covalent bonds differ?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: In <strong>ionic bonds</strong>, electrons are transferred (e.g., NaCl). In <strong>covalent bonds</strong>, electrons are shared (e.g., H₂O). Hydrogen bonds are weak attractions between polar molecules.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Properties of Water</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Why is water essential for life?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Water's polarity leads to hydrogen bonding, which gives it high specific heat, cohesion, adhesion, and solvent properties. Ice floats because water expands upon freezing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. pH and Buffers</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the pH scale and why do buffers matter?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: pH measures hydrogen ion concentration (0-14 scale; 7 is neutral). Buffers resist pH changes by absorbing or releasing H⁺ ions, critical for enzyme function.</li>
</ul>
