<h1>Module 2: Basic Chemistry</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Describe</strong> the structure of an atom and the properties of its subatomic particles.
2.  <strong>Compar</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong> ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds.
3.  <strong>Explain</strong> the unique life-supporting properties of water resulting from its polarity.
4.  <strong>Interpret</strong> the pH scale and explain the importance of buffers in homeostasis.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Matter</strong>: Anything that has mass and takes up space.
- [ ] <strong>Isotope</strong>: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
- [ ] <strong>Valence Shell</strong>: The outermost electron shell; determines reactivity.
- [ ] <strong>Cation vs. Anion</strong>: Positively charged ion vs. negatively charged ion.
- [ ] <strong>Electronegativity</strong>: A measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons.
- [ ] <strong>Solute vs. Solvent</strong>: The substance being dissolved vs. the dissolving medium (usually water).
- [ ] <strong>Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic</strong>: Water-loving vs. water-fearing.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. Atomic Math</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How are Atomic Number and Atomic Mass calculated?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: If an atom has an Atomic Number of 6 and a Mass Number of 12, how many neutrons does it have? What if the Mass Number is 14? (Hint: This is an isotope).</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Bonding Basics</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How do ionic and covalent bonds differ?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Why is Sodium Chloride (NaCl) an ionic bond, while Water (H2O) is a covalent bond? Think about what the electrons are doing (transferred vs. shared).</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. The Power of pH</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What regions of the pH scale relate to acids, bases, and neutral substances?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Why is "acid rain" harmful to forests and lakes? Connect this back to the sensitivity of biological molecules to pH changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CHNOPS</strong>: Remember the six most common elements in life: Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulfur.</li>
<li><strong>Draw it out</strong>: Sketch a water molecule. Label the Oxygen (delta negative) and Hydrogen (delta positive) and draw dotted lines to neighboring water molecules to represent Hydrogen bonds. Visualizing this makes "polarity" makes sense.</li>
<li><strong>The "Shell" Game</strong>: When looking at the Periodic Table, look at the columns (Groups). Group 1 atoms have 1 valence electron (highly reactive). Group 8 (Noble gases) have full shells (inert).</li>
</ul>
