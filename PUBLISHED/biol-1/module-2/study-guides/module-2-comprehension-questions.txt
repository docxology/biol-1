Module 2: Basic Chemistry
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
Atomic Structure
       Identify the three subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons). Describe their location, relative mass, and charge.
       What determines the identity of an element?

Chemical Bonding
       Define the Octet Rule. Why do atoms form bonds?
       Differentiate between ionic bonds, covalent bonds (polar and non-polar), and hydrogen bonds.

Properties of Water
       Explain why water is a polar molecule. How does polarity lead to hydrogen bonding?
       List four properties of water critical for life: cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat, solvent properties.

Part 2: Application
pH and Buffers
       The pH scale is logarithmic. How much more acidic is a solution with pH 3 compared to pH 6?
       Explain the role of buffers in biological systems. What happens if blood pH shifts from 7.4 to 6.8?

Isotopes in Biology
       Scenario: A paleontologist discovers a fossil and wants to determine its age.
       Apply: Explain how radioactive isotopes (e.g., Carbon-14) and half-life calculations are used in radiometric dating.

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Reactivity and Stability
       Analyze the relationship between electron configuration and chemical reactivity.
       Why are noble gases (He, Ne, Ar) largely unreactive?

Water in Ecosystems
       Ice floats because solid water is less dense than liquid water.
       Analyze how this property affects aquatic ecosystems in winter. What would happen if ice sank?
