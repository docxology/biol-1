Module 2: Basic Chemistry
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
Atomic Structure
       Identify the three subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons). Describe their location within the atom, relative mass, and electrical charge.
       What determines the "identity" of an atom (i.e., which element it is)?

Chemical Bonding
       Define the Octet Rule. Why do atoms form bonds?
       Differentiate between the three major types of bonds in biological systems: Ionic, Covalent (polar and non-polar), and Hydrogen bonds.

Properties of Water
       Explain why water is considered a "polar" molecule. How does this polarity lead to hydrogen bonding?
       List four distinct properties of water that are critical for life (e.g., cohesion, high specific heat).

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
pH and Buffers
       The pH scale is logarithmic. Mathematically, how much more acidic is a solution with pH 3 compared to pH 6?
       Explain the role of buffers in biological systems (like human blood). What happens if a biological system's pH shifts too drastically?

Isotopes in Biology
       Scenario: A paleontologist finds a fossil and wants to know its age.
       Apply: How can radioactive isotopes (like Carbon-14) be used to solve this problem? What is "half-life"?

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Reactivity and Stability
       Analyze the relationship between an atom's electron shell configuration and its chemical reactivity. Why are "Noble Gases" (like Helium or Neon) generally unreactive?

Water in Ecosystems
       Water becomes less dense when it freezes (ice floats). Analyze how this specific property affects aquatic life in a lake during winter. What would happen if ice sank?
