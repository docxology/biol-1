Module 2: Basic Chemistry
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Describe the structure of an atom and the properties of its subatomic particles.
Compar and contrast ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds.
Explain the unique life-supporting properties of water resulting from its polarity.
Interpret the pH scale and explain the importance of buffers in homeostasis.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.
[ ] Matter: Anything that has mass and takes up space.
[ ] Isotope: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
[ ] Valence Shell: The outermost electron shell; determines reactivity.
[ ] Cation vs. Anion: Positively charged ion vs. negatively charged ion.
[ ] Electronegativity: A measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons.
[ ] Solute vs. Solvent: The substance being dissolved vs. the dissolving medium (usually water).
[ ] Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic: Water-loving vs. water-fearing.

Concept Check
Atomic Math
   Question: How are Atomic Number and Atomic Mass calculated?
   Deep Dive: If an atom has an Atomic Number of 6 and a Mass Number of 12, how many neutrons does it have? What if the Mass Number is 14? (Hint: This is an isotope).

Bonding Basics
   Question: How do ionic and covalent bonds differ?
   Deep Dive: Why is Sodium Chloride (NaCl) an ionic bond, while Water (H2O) is a covalent bond? Think about what the electrons are doing (transferred vs. shared).

The Power of pH
   Question: What regions of the pH scale relate to acids, bases, and neutral substances?
   Deep Dive: Why is "acid rain" harmful to forests and lakes? Connect this back to the sensitivity of biological molecules to pH changes.

Study Tips
   CHNOPS: Remember the six most common elements in life: Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulfur.
   Draw it out: Sketch a water molecule. Label the Oxygen (delta negative) and Hydrogen (delta positive) and draw dotted lines to neighboring water molecules to represent Hydrogen bonds. Visualizing this makes "polarity" makes sense.
The "Shell" Game: When looking at the Periodic Table, look at the columns (Groups). Group 1 atoms have 1 valence electron (highly reactive). Group 8 (Noble gases) have full shells (inert).
