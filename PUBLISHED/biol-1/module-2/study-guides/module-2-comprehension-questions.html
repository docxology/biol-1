<h1>Module 2: Basic Chemistry</h1>
<h2>Comprehension &amp; Critical Thinking Questions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Atomic Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the three subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons). Describe their location within the atom, relative mass, and electrical charge.</li>
<li>What determines the "identity" of an atom (i.e., which element it is)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chemical Bonding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define the <strong>Octet Rule</strong>. Why do atoms form bonds?</li>
<li>Differentiate between the three major types of bonds in biological systems: <strong>Ionic</strong>, <strong>Covalent</strong> (polar and non-polar), and <strong>Hydrogen</strong> bonds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Properties of Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why water is considered a "polar" molecule. How does this polarity lead to hydrogen bonding?</li>
<li>List four distinct properties of water that are critical for life (e.g., cohesion, high specific heat).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Applying Biological Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>pH and Buffers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The pH scale is logarithmic. Mathematically, how much more acidic is a solution with pH 3 compared to pH 6?</li>
<li>Explain the role of <strong>buffers</strong> in biological systems (like human blood). What happens if a biological system's pH shifts too drastically?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isotopes in Biology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A paleontologist finds a fossil and wants to know its age.</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong>: How can <strong>radioactive isotopes</strong> (like Carbon-14) be used to solve this problem? What is "half-life"?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Analyzing &amp; Evaluating</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reactivity and Stability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the relationship between an atom's electron shell configuration and its chemical reactivity. Why are "Noble Gases" (like Helium or Neon) generally unreactive?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Water in Ecosystems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Water becomes less dense when it freezes (ice floats). Analyze how this specific property affects aquatic life in a lake during winter. What would happen if ice sank?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
