<h1>Module 6: Metabolism</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Differentiate</strong> between kinetic/potential energy and exergonic/endergonic reactions.</li>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> how enzymes catalyze reactions and how they are regulated by environmental factors.</li>
<li><strong>Describe</strong> the ATP cycle and its role in energy coupling.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong> metabolic control via feedback inhibition and redox reactions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <strong>Entropy</strong>: A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Substrate</strong>: The specific reactant on which an enzyme acts.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Active Site</strong>: The region of an enzyme where the substrate binds.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Allosteric Regulation</strong>: Regulation of enzyme activity by binding of an effector molecule at a site other than the active site.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Phosphorylation</strong>: The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule, often transferring energy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. Thermodynamics and Life</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How can complex, ordered life exist in a universe tending toward entropy?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Living organisms are open systems that maintain order by increasing entropy elsewhere. Metabolism releases heat, which increases overall entropy. Life obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Enzyme Mechanism</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How do enzymes work?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Enzymes lower activation energy by stabilizing the transition state. The Induced Fit Model describes how the enzyme active site conforms to the substrate upon binding.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Energy Coupling</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How is ATP used to power cellular processes?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: ATP hydrolysis is exergonic (ΔG &lt; 0). This energy is coupled to endergonic reactions (ΔG &gt; 0) through phosphate transfer or conformational changes in proteins.</li>
</ul>
