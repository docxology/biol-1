Module 6: Metabolism
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
Energy Basics
       Differentiate between kinetic and potential energy using biological examples.
       State the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. How do living systems obey the second law while maintaining order?

Enzymes
       What is activation energy? How do enzymes lower it?
       Explain competitive inhibition vs. non-competitive (allosteric) inhibition.

ATP Structure
       Describe the structure of ATP. Which bonds contain the most energy (phosphoanhydride bonds)?

Part 2: Application
Metabolic Pathways
       Compare anabolic (biosynthetic) and catabolic (degradative) pathways.
       Is photosynthesis anabolic or catabolic? Is cellular respiration anabolic or catabolic?

Enzyme Regulation
       Scenario: Pepsin functions optimally at pH 2 (stomach).
       Apply: What happens to pepsin activity in the blood (pH 7.4)? Explain in terms of denaturation.

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Redox Reactions
       "OIL RIG": Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain (of electrons).
       In the reaction A⁻ + B → A + B⁻, identify which molecule is oxidized and which is reduced.

Feedback Inhibition
       Explain feedback inhibition. Why is it efficient for the end-product of a pathway to inhibit the first enzyme?
