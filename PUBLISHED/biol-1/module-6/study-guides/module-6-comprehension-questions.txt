Module 6: Metabolism
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
Energy Basics
       Differentiate between Kinetic and Potential energy using biological examples (e.g., a concentration gradient vs. muscle movement).
       State the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. How do living things obey the second law (entropy) while creating ordered structures?

Enzymes
       What is Activation Energy? How do enzymes lower it?
       Explain the difference between Competitive and Non-competitive inhibition. Where does the inhibitor bind in each case?

ATP Structure
       Draw or describe the structure of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). Which bond is the "high energy" bond that is broken to release energy?

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
Metabolic Pathways
       Compare Anabolic (building up) and Catabolic (breaking down) pathways.
       Application: Is photosynthesis anabolic or catabolic? Is cellular respiration anabolic or catabolic? Explain your reasoning.

Enzyme Regulation
       Scenario: You have an enzyme that functions best in the human stomach (pH 2).
       Apply: What happens to this enzyme's activity if it is moved to the blood (pH 7.4)? Explain why in terms of protein structure (denaturation).

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Redox Reactions
       "OIL RIG" stands for Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain (of electrons). Analyze the following generic reaction: A- + B -> A + B-. Which molecule was oxidized? Which was reduced?

Feedback Loops
    *   Explain the concept of Feedback Inhibition. Why is it efficient for the end-product of a pathway to shut down the first enzyme in that pathway?
