<h1>Module 6: Metabolism</h1>
<h2>Comprehension &amp; Critical Thinking Questions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Basics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiate between <strong>Kinetic</strong> and <strong>Potential</strong> energy using biological examples (e.g., a concentration gradient vs. muscle movement).</li>
<li>State the <strong>First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics</strong>. How do living things obey the second law (entropy) while creating ordered structures?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enzymes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is <strong>Activation Energy</strong>? How do enzymes lower it?</li>
<li>Explain the difference between <strong>Competitive</strong> and <strong>Non-competitive</strong> inhibition. Where does the inhibitor bind in each case?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ATP Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draw or describe the structure of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). Which bond is the "high energy" bond that is broken to release energy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Applying Biological Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Metabolic Pathways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compare <strong>Anabolic</strong> (building up) and <strong>Catabolic</strong> (breaking down) pathways.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: Is photosynthesis anabolic or catabolic? Is cellular respiration anabolic or catabolic? Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enzyme Regulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: You have an enzyme that functions best in the human stomach (pH 2).</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong>: What happens to this enzyme's activity if it is moved to the blood (pH 7.4)? Explain <em>why</em> in terms of protein structure (denaturation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Analyzing &amp; Evaluating</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Redox Reactions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"OIL RIG" stands for <em>Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain</em> (of electrons). Analyze the following generic reaction: A- + B -&gt; A + B-. Which molecule was oxidized? Which was reduced?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feedback Loops</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the concept of <strong>Feedback Inhibition</strong>. Why is it efficient for the end-product of a pathway to shut down the first enzyme in that pathway?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
