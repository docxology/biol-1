Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts
Defining Microevolution
       Evolution is "change in allele frequency." If a population is 50% Brown Eye Alleles and 50% Blue Eye Alleles, and 100 years later it is 90% Brown/10% Blue, has evolution occurred?

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
       What does the Hardy-Weinberg principle state?
       List the Five Conditions required for a population NOT to evolve (No mutation, No gene flow, etc.). Are these conditions common in nature?

Genetic Drift
       Define Genetic Drift. Does it have a stronger effect on Large or Small populations?
       Distinguish between the Bottleneck Effect (disaster) and the Founder Effect (colonization).

Part 2: Applying Biological Principles
Types of Selection
       Draw three graphs representing:
           Directional Selection (Shift to one extreme).
           Stabilizing Selection (Average is favored).
           Disruptive Selection (Both extremes favored).
       Give a real-world example of each (e.g., Birth weight, Beak size).

Heterozygote Advantage
       Sickle Cell Anemia is a deadly recessive disease. Why is the allele so common in parts of Africa?
       Apply: How does this demonstrate that "Fitness" depends on the environment? (Malaria presence).

Part 3: Analyzing & Evaluating
Sexual Selection
       Peacocks have giant tails that make them slow and visible to predators. Analyze: How can Natural Selection (survival) allow this trait to exist? (Hint: Reproduction vs Survival).

Gene Flow
       Two populations of deer are separated by a mountain. A tunnel is built, allowing them to mix.
    *   Analyze: Will the two populations become more similar or more different genetically? Does this increase or decrease the chance of them becoming separate species?
