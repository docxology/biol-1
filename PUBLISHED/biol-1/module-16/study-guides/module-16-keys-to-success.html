<h1>Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Calculate</strong> allele and genotype frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg equations.
2.  <strong>Differentiate</strong> between the effects of Genetic Drift, Gene Flow, and Natural Selection.
3.  <strong>Identify</strong> patterns of selection (Stabilizing, Directional, Disruptive) from data.
4.  <strong>Explain</strong> how Heterozygote Advantage maintains deadly alleles in a population.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Gene Pool</strong>: All the alleles in a population.
- [ ] <strong>Microevolution</strong>: Small-scale changes in allele frequencies generation to generation.
- [ ] <strong>Sexual Dimorphism</strong>: Differences in appearance between males and females.
- [ ] <strong>Gene Flow</strong>: Movement of alleles between populations (Migration).
- [ ] <strong>Bottleneck Effect</strong>: Loss of genetic diversity due to a drastic reduction in population size.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Null Hypothesis</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the 5 criteria for stable allele frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg)?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>:<ol>
<li>No Mutation.</li>
<li>No Gene Flow.</li>
<li>No Natural Selection.</li>
<li>Random Mating.</li>
<li>Extremely Large Population.</li>
<li><em>Real Talk</em>: This basically never happens. Evolution is inevitable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. The Math</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the two equations?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>p + q = 1</strong> (Allele Frequency: Dominant + Recessive = 100%).</li>
<li><strong>p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1</strong> (Genotype Frequency: AA + Aa + aa = 100%).</li>
<li><em>Tip</em>: Always find <strong>q</strong> (recessive frequency) first. You can "see" recessive phenotypes. You can't see carriers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Luck of the Draw</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is genetic drift?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Random chance. If you flip a coin 1000 times, it's 50/50. If you flip it 4 times, you might get 100% heads. Small populations (4 flips) are subject to wild random swings (Drift). Large populations are stable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphs</strong>: Memorize the shapes of selection graphs.<ul>
<li><strong>Directional</strong>: Bell curve moves Left/Right.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilizing</strong>: Bell curve gets skinny/tall (Variance decreases).</li>
<li><strong>Disruptive</strong>: Bell curve gets two humps (M shape).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Peacock Logic</strong>: Sexual Selection is powerful. If females prefer long tails, males get long tails, even if it kills them. Copulation &gt; Survival.</li>
</ul>
