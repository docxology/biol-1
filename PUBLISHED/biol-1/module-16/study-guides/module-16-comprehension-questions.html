<h1>Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)</h1>
<h2>Comprehension &amp; Critical Thinking Questions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Defining Microevolution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution is "change in allele frequency." If a population is 50% Brown Eye Alleles and 50% Blue Eye Alleles, and 100 years later it is 90% Brown/10% Blue, has evolution occurred?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What does the Hardy-Weinberg principle state?</li>
<li>List the <strong>Five Conditions</strong> required for a population NOT to evolve (No mutation, No gene flow, etc.). Are these conditions common in nature?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genetic Drift</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define <strong>Genetic Drift</strong>. Does it have a stronger effect on Large or Small populations?</li>
<li>Distinguish between the <strong>Bottleneck Effect</strong> (disaster) and the <strong>Founder Effect</strong> (colonization).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Applying Biological Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of Selection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draw three graphs representing:<ul>
<li><strong>Directional Selection</strong> (Shift to one extreme).</li>
<li><strong>Stabilizing Selection</strong> (Average is favored).</li>
<li><strong>Disruptive Selection</strong> (Both extremes favored).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give a real-world example of each (e.g., Birth weight, Beak size).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heterozygote Advantage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sickle Cell Anemia is a deadly recessive disease. Why is the allele so common in parts of Africa?</li>
<li><strong>Apply</strong>: How does this demonstrate that "Fitness" depends on the environment? (Malaria presence).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Analyzing &amp; Evaluating</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sexual Selection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Peacocks have giant tails that make them slow and visible to predators. <strong>Analyze</strong>: How can Natural Selection (survival) allow this trait to exist? (Hint: Reproduction vs Survival).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gene Flow</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two populations of deer are separated by a mountain. A tunnel is built, allowing them to mix.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong>: Will the two populations become more similar or more different genetically? Does this increase or decrease the chance of them becoming separate species?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
