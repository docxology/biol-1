Module 9: Cell Division and Mitosis
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Sequence the phases of the eukaryotic cell cycle and mitosis.
Differentiate between chromatin, chromosomes, and sister chromatids.
Compare cytokinesis in plant and animal cells.
Explain the genetic basis of cancer (oncogenes vs. tumor suppressors).

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.
[ ] Somatic Cell: Body cells (Diploid).
[ ] Gamete: Sex cells (Haploid).
[ ] Sister Chromatids: Identical copies of a chromosome rejoined at the centromere.
[ ] Centromere: The waist where chromatids are attached.
[ ] Metastasis: The spread of cancer cells to different parts of the body.
[ ] Genome: The total genetic information of an organism.

Concept Check
Timing is Everything
   Question: Which phase takes up the bulk of the cell cycle?
   Deep Dive: Interphase takes up ~90% of the time. Mitosis is very short. Why? (Think about preparations vs. the actual act of splitting).

The Guardian of the Genome
   Question: What is the role of p53?
   Deep Dive: p53 is a Tumor Suppressor. If DNA is damaged, p53 halts division to repair it. If it can't be repaired, p53 triggers Apoptosis. If p53 is mutated/broken, what happens? (Cancer often follows).

Bad Brakes and Stuck Gas
   Question: What kinds of genes are involved in cancer?
   Deep Dive:
       Proto-oncogenes: Enhance division (Gas pedal). Mutate to become Oncogenes (Gas stuck down).
       Tumor Suppressors: Stop division (Brake pedal). Mutate to break (Brakes cut).

Prokaryote Comparison
   Question: Through what process do prokaryotes replicate?
   Deep Dive: Binary Fission. They have a single circular chromosome. They replicate it and pull apart. Simplistic compared to the dance of 46 chromosomes in humans.

Study Tips
   Hand Signals: Use your hands to model mitosis phases.
       Prophase: Fingers spread (chromosomes condense).
       Metaphase: Hands together (align middle).
       Anaphase: Hands pull apart.
       Telophase: Two fists (two nuclei).
   Chromosome Math: Confused by "46 chromosomes vs 92 chromatids"?
    *   Count the Centromeres. If there is one waist, it is ONE chromosome (even if it has two legs/chromatids).
