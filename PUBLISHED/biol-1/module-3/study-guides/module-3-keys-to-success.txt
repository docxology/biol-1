Module 3: Organic Molecules
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Classify the four major groups of biological macromolecules and identifying their constituent monomers.
Explain the chemical reactions (dehydration synthesis/hydrolysis) that build and break polymers.
Correlate the structural levels of proteins with their specific functions and vulnerability to denaturation.
Differentiate between DNA, RNA, and ATP in terms of structure and function.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.
[ ] Macromolecule: A giant molecule formed by the joining of smaller molecules.
[ ] Hydrophobic: Repelling water (characteristic of lipids).
[ ] Peptide Bond: The covalent bond between two amino acid units.
[ ] Nucleotide: Assembled from a sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base.
[ ] Enzyme: A protein that acts as a catalyst.
[ ] Phospholipid: The key structural component of cell membranes.

Concept Check
Carbohydrate Complexity
   Question: What is the most main role of carbohydrates?
   Deep Dive: How does the structure of a storage polysaccharide (like Glycogen) differ from a structural polysaccharide (like Cellulose)? Why is branching important for quick energy release?

The Lipid Family
   Question: What is the solubility of lipids?
   Deep Dive: Why are steroids (like cholesterol and testosterone) grouped with fats and oils even though they look completely different (ring structure)? (Hint: Do they mix with water?)

Protein Versatility
   Question: What are at least 6 roles of proteins?
   Deep Dive: Proteins do almost everything (transport, enzymes, defense, structure). If a genetic mutation changes just one amino acid in the primary sequence (like in Sickle Cell Anemia), why does it have such catastrophic effects on the whole organism?

Nucleic Acid Code
   Question: How do the two strands found in a DNA molecule stick together?
   Deep Dive: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. If a DNA sample is 20% Adenine, what percentage is Guanine? (Chargaff's Rule).

Study Tips
   Use your hands: To understand Protein folding, use a piece of wire or a pipe cleaner.
       Straight = Primary.
       Coiled = Secondary.
       Ballet up into a glob = Tertiary.
   Suffixes: Learn to recognize chemical names.
       -ose = Sugar (Glucose, Fructose).
       -ase = Enzyme (Lactase, Amylase).
       -in = Often a protein (Hemoglobin, Insulin).
   Flashcards for Monomers:
       Carbs -> Monosaccharides.
       Proteins -> Amino Acids.
       Nucleic Acids -> Nucleotides.
    *   Lipids -> (No true monomer, but Glycerol + Fatty Acids).
