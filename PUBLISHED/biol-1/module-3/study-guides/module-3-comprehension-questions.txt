Module 3: Organic Molecules
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
The Nature of Organic Molecules
       What makes a molecule "organic"? Why is carbon the "backbone" of life?
       Define functional group and provide an example (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl).

Building Blocks
       Explain the relationship between monomers and polymers.
       Describe dehydration synthesis (releases water, builds polymers) and hydrolysis (uses water, breaks polymers).

The Four Classes of Biomolecules
       Create a summary table comparing Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, and Nucleic Acids. Include monomer names, key functions, and example molecules.

Part 2: Application
Protein Folding
       Protein function depends on its three-dimensional shape. Explain the four levels of protein structure:
           Primary: Linear amino acid sequence.
           Secondary: Alpha helices and beta pleated sheets (hydrogen bonding).
           Tertiary: 3D folding (R-group interactions, disulfide bridges).
           Quaternary: Multiple polypeptide subunits.
       Apply: What is denaturation? Why doesn't a cooked egg unfold when cooled?

Lipids and Health
       Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in terms of structure and physical state at room temperature.

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Structure Determines Function
       Cellulose and starch are both glucose polymers. Why can humans digest starch but not cellulose? Analyze the role of glycosidic linkage orientation.

ATP as Energy Currency
       ATP is derived from a nucleotide. Explain where the energy is stored (phosphoanhydride bonds) and why ATP is called the "energy currency" of the cell.
