<h1>Module 3: Organic Molecules</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Classify</strong> the four major groups of biological macromolecules and identifying their constituent monomers.
2.  <strong>Explain</strong> the chemical reactions (dehydration synthesis/hydrolysis) that build and break polymers.
3.  <strong>Correlate</strong> the structural levels of proteins with their specific functions and vulnerability to denaturation.
4.  <strong>Differentiate</strong> between DNA, RNA, and ATP in terms of structure and function.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Macromolecule</strong>: A giant molecule formed by the joining of smaller molecules.
- [ ] <strong>Hydrophobic</strong>: Repelling water (characteristic of lipids).
- [ ] <strong>Peptide Bond</strong>: The covalent bond between two amino acid units.
- [ ] <strong>Nucleotide</strong>: Assembled from a sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base.
- [ ] <strong>Enzyme</strong>: A protein that acts as a catalyst.
- [ ] <strong>Phospholipid</strong>: The key structural component of cell membranes.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. Carbohydrate Complexity</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the most main role of carbohydrates?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: How does the structure of a storage polysaccharide (like <strong>Glycogen</strong>) differ from a structural polysaccharide (like <strong>Cellulose</strong>)? Why is branching important for quick energy release?</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. The Lipid Family</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the solubility of lipids?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Why are steroids (like cholesterol and testosterone) grouped with fats and oils even though they look completely different (ring structure)? (Hint: Do they mix with water?)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Protein Versatility</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are at least 6 roles of proteins?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Proteins do almost everything (transport, enzymes, defense, structure). If a genetic mutation changes just <em>one</em> amino acid in the primary sequence (like in Sickle Cell Anemia), why does it have such catastrophic effects on the whole organism?</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Nucleic Acid Code</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How do the two strands found in a DNA molecule stick together?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. If a DNA sample is 20% Adenine, what percentage is Guanine? (Chargaff's Rule).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use your hands</strong>: To understand Protein folding, use a piece of wire or a pipe cleaner.<ul>
<li>Straight = Primary.</li>
<li>Coiled = Secondary.</li>
<li>Ballet up into a glob = Tertiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Suffixes</strong>: Learn to recognize chemical names.<ul>
<li><em>-ose</em> = Sugar (Glucose, Fructose).</li>
<li><em>-ase</em> = Enzyme (Lactase, Amylase).</li>
<li><em>-in</em> = Often a protein (Hemoglobin, Insulin).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Flashcards for Monomers</strong>:<ul>
<li>Carbs -&gt; Monosaccharides.</li>
<li>Proteins -&gt; Amino Acids.</li>
<li>Nucleic Acids -&gt; Nucleotides.</li>
<li>Lipids -&gt; (No true monomer, but Glycerol + Fatty Acids).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
