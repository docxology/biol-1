<h1>Module 3: Organic Molecules</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Classify</strong> the four major groups of biological macromolecules and identify their constituent monomers.</li>
<li><strong>Explain</strong> the chemical reactions (dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis) that build and break polymers.</li>
<li><strong>Correlate</strong> the structural levels of proteins with their specific functions and vulnerability to denaturation.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiate</strong> between DNA, RNA, and ATP in terms of structure and function.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <strong>Macromolecule</strong>: A large organic molecule formed by the polymerization of smaller subunits (monomers).</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Hydrophobic</strong>: Repelling water; characteristic of non-polar molecules like lipids.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Peptide Bond</strong>: The covalent bond linking two amino acids together.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Nucleotide</strong>: The monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Enzyme</strong>: A protein catalyst that accelerates biochemical reactions.</li>
<li>[ ] <strong>Phospholipid</strong>: An amphipathic lipid with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails; the structural basis of cell membranes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. Carbohydrates</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the primary function of carbohydrates?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Energy storage (starch, glycogen) and structural support (cellulose, chitin).</li>
<li><strong>Distinction</strong>: Storage polysaccharides (glycogen) are branched for rapid glucose release; structural polysaccharides (cellulose) form linear, rigid fibers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Lipids</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What defines a lipid?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Lipids are hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules including fats, phospholipids, and steroids. They share insolubility in water, not structural similarity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Proteins</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What roles do proteins serve?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Enzymes, structural components, transport carriers, antibodies, hormones, and motor proteins. A single amino acid change (e.g., sickle cell mutation) can disrupt protein folding and function.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Nucleic Acids</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How do the two strands of DNA remain associated?</li>
<li><strong>Key Answer</strong>: Complementary base pairing via hydrogen bonds: Adenine-Thymine (2 bonds) and Guanine-Cytosine (3 bonds). This follows Chargaff's Rules: %A = %T and %G = %C.</li>
</ul>
