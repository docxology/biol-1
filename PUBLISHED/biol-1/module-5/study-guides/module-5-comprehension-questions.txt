Module 5: Membranes
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
Membrane Architecture
       Describe the Fluid Mosaic Model. Why is the membrane described as "fluid"? What constitutes the "mosaic"?
       Sketch a phospholipid. Label the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails. Explain why phospholipids self-assemble into a bilayer in aqueous environments.

Permeability
       Membranes are selectively permeable. List molecules that pass freely (small, nonpolar) and those that require transport proteins (large, polar, ions).

Transport Mechanisms
       Define diffusion. Does it require energy?
       Define osmosis. In which direction does water move relative to solute concentration?

Part 2: Application
Tonicity
       Scenario: Red blood cells are placed in three beakers:
           Beaker A: Pure distilled water.
           Beaker B: 0.9% saline (matches blood).
           Beaker C: 10% saline solution.
       Apply: Predict the outcome for cells in each beaker. Identify which solution is hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic.

Active Transport
       Contrast passive transport (diffusion, facilitated diffusion) with active transport.
       The Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pumps 3 Na⁺ out and 2 K⁺ in per ATP hydrolyzed. Why does this require energy?

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Bulk Transport
       Distinguish endocytosis (phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated) from exocytosis.
       How do these processes depend on membrane fluidity?

Cell Signaling
    *   Explain the role of receptor proteins and glycoproteins in cell communication. How does a cell "know" a hormone is present in the extracellular fluid?
