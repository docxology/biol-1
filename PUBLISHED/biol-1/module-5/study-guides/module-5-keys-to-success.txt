Module 5: Membranes
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Diagram the structure of the plasma membrane according to the Fluid Mosaic Model.
Predict the movement of water and solutes across a membrane under various osmotic conditions.
Compare and contrast passive and active transport mechanisms.
Explain how large molecules traverse the membrane via bulk transport (endocytosis/exocytosis).

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Amphipathic: Having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions (characteristic of phospholipids).
[ ] Concentration Gradient: The difference in solute concentration across a distance.
[ ] Aquaporin: A channel protein that facilitates rapid water transport.
[ ] Turgor Pressure: The pressure exerted by water pushing the plasma membrane against the cell wall in plant cells.
[ ] Ligand: A molecule that binds specifically to a receptor protein.

Concept Check
Membrane Structure
   Question: What are the three main components of the plasma membrane?
   Key Answer: Phospholipids (bilayer barrier), proteins (transport, signaling, structure), and cholesterol (membrane fluidity regulation). Cholesterol prevents membrane rigidity in cold and excess fluidity in heat.

Passive vs. Active Transport
   Question: When is active transport necessary?
   Key Answer: When solutes must move against their concentration gradient (low to high concentration). This requires ATP and transport proteins (e.g., Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase).

Tonicity
   Question: Define isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions.
   Key Answer:
       Hypertonic: Higher solute concentration outside → water exits cell → cell shrinks (crenation in animal cells, plasmolysis in plant cells).
       Hypotonic: Lower solute concentration outside → water enters cell → cell swells (lysis in animal cells, turgidity in plant cells).
       Isotonic: Equal solute concentration → no net water movement.

Bulk Transport
   Question: How do large substances cross the membrane?
Key Answer: Endocytosis (phagocytosis, pinocytosis) brings material in; exocytosis releases material. Both require membrane flexibility and ATP.
