Module 5: Membranes
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
Diagram the structure of the plasma membrane (Fluid Mosaic Model).
Predict the movement of water and solutes across a membrane in various osmotic conditions.
Compare and contrast passive and active transport mechanisms.
Explain how large molecules traverse the membrane via bulk transport.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.
[ ] Amphipathic: Having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts.
[ ] Concentration Gradient: The difference in concentration of a substance across a space.
[ ] Aquaporin: A channel protein specifically for rapid water transport.
[ ] Turgor Pressure: The pressure of water pushing the plasma membrane against the cell wall of a plant cell.
[ ] Ligand: A molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site.

Concept Check
The Gatekeeper
   Question: What are the three main components in a cell membrane?
   Deep Dive: Phospholipids (barrier), Proteins (doors/workers), and Cholesterol (stabilizer). How does Cholesterol prevent the membrane from freezing in the cold or melting in the heat?

Just Passing Through
   Question: When would active transport be necessary?
   Deep Dive: Usually things flow "downhill" (high to low). If you need to pump water "uphill," you need a pump and electricity. In cells, if you need to gather specific nutrients against their gradient, you need a Protein Pump and ATP.

Water Wars
   Question: What is the meaning of isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic solutions?
   Deep Dive: Remember, water chases the solute.
       Hyper (High solute) -> Water leaves cell (Shrivel).
       Hypo (Low solute) -> Water enters cell (Burst/Turgid).
       Iso (Equal) -> Equilibrium.
       Tip: Freshwater fish live in a Hypotonic environment. Why don't they explode? (Kidneys/Gills).

Big Gulp
   Question: How are very large substances brought into and pushed out of cells?
   Deep Dive: Phagocytosis ("Cell Eating"). White blood cells use this to devour bacteria. It involves the membrane wrapping around the target and pinching off a vesicle.

Study Tips
   Draw the Diagram: Seriously, draw the Fluid Mosaic Model. Label the Heads, Tails, Integral Proteins, Peripheral Proteins, Carbohydrate chains.
   Scenario Practice: Don't just memorize "Hypertonic = Shrivel." Visualize a slug with salt on it. The salt is Hypertonic. The water leaves the slug's cells to dilute the salt. result: Slug shrivels.
   Gradient Gravity: Think of Concentration Gradients like Gravity.
       Passive Transport = Rolling a ball down a hill (Easy, no energy).
    *   Active Transport = Pushing a ball up a hill (Hard, requires energy/ATP).
