<h1>Module 5: Membranes</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Diagram</strong> the structure of the plasma membrane (Fluid Mosaic Model).
2.  <strong>Predict</strong> the movement of water and solutes across a membrane in various osmotic conditions.
3.  <strong>Compare</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong> passive and active transport mechanisms.
4.  <strong>Explain</strong> how large molecules traverse the membrane via bulk transport.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Amphipathic</strong>: Having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts.
- [ ] <strong>Concentration Gradient</strong>: The difference in concentration of a substance across a space.
- [ ] <strong>Aquaporin</strong>: A channel protein specifically for rapid water transport.
- [ ] <strong>Turgor Pressure</strong>: The pressure of water pushing the plasma membrane against the cell wall of a plant cell.
- [ ] <strong>Ligand</strong>: A molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. The Gatekeeper</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the three main components in a cell membrane?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Phospholipids (barrier), Proteins (doors/workers), and Cholesterol (stabilizer). How does Cholesterol prevent the membrane from freezing in the cold or melting in the heat?</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Just Passing Through</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: When would active transport be necessary?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Usually things flow "downhill" (high to low). If you need to pump water "uphill," you need a pump and electricity. In cells, if you need to gather specific nutrients <em>against</em> their gradient, you need a Protein Pump and ATP.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Water Wars</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the meaning of isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic solutions?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Remember, water chases the solute.<ul>
<li><strong>Hyper</strong> (High solute) -&gt; Water leaves cell (Shrivel).</li>
<li><strong>Hypo</strong> (Low solute) -&gt; Water enters cell (Burst/Turgid).</li>
<li><strong>Iso</strong> (Equal) -&gt; Equilibrium.</li>
<li><em>Tip</em>: Freshwater fish live in a Hypotonic environment. Why don't they explode? (Kidneys/Gills).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Big Gulp</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How are very large substances brought into and pushed out of cells?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: <strong>Phagocytosis</strong> ("Cell Eating"). White blood cells use this to devour bacteria. It involves the membrane wrapping around the target and pinching off a vesicle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draw the Diagram</strong>: Seriously, draw the Fluid Mosaic Model. Label the Heads, Tails, Integral Proteins, Peripheral Proteins, Carbohydrate chains.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Practice</strong>: Don't just memorize "Hypertonic = Shrivel." Visualize a slug with salt on it. The salt is Hypertonic. The water leaves the slug's cells to dilute the salt. result: Slug shrivels.</li>
<li><strong>Gradient Gravity</strong>: Think of Concentration Gradients like Gravity.<ul>
<li>Passive Transport = Rolling a ball down a hill (Easy, no energy).</li>
<li>Active Transport = Pushing a ball up a hill (Hard, requires energy/ATP).</li>
</ul>
