<h1>Module 15: Darwin and Evolution</h1>
<h2>Keys to Success &amp; Study Guide</h2>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1.  <strong>Describe</strong> the key components of Darwin's theory of Natural Selection.
2.  <strong>Contrast</strong> Homologous and Analogous structures as evidence for evolution.
3.  <strong>Explain</strong> how fossil and biochemical evidence supports the theory of common descent.
4.  <strong>Apply</strong> the concept of "fitness" to evolutionary scenarios.</p>
<h3>Key Terminology Checklist</h3>
<p><em>Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.</em>
- [ ] <strong>Adaptation</strong>: A trait that increases survival/reproduction in a specific environment.
- [ ] <strong>Biogeography</strong>: The study of the distribution of species across the planet.
- [ ] <strong>Transitional Fossil</strong>: A fossil that shows intermediate states between an ancestral form and its descendants.
- [ ] <strong>Convergent Evolution</strong>: Different species independently evolving similar traits (Analogous structures).
- [ ] <strong>Industrial Melanism</strong>: The classic example of moths changing color due to soot pollution.</p>
<h3>Concept Check</h3>
<h4>1. Misconception Busting</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What is the most basic definition of evolution?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: "Change in allele frequency over time."</li>
<li><strong>Important</strong>: Individuals do NOT evolve. You cannot change your DNA. Populations evolve over generations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Darwin's Inspiration</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: How did the Galapagos finches inspire Darwin?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: He noticed distinct beak shapes on different islands.<ul>
<li>Big beaks = Nut crackers (Dry islands).</li>
<li>Small beaks = Insect eaters.</li>
<li>Conclusion: One ancestor arrived, and they adapted to different niches (<em>Adaptive Radiation</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Old Bones</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are homologous structures?</li>
<li><strong>Deep Dive</strong>: Same Bone Structure, Different Job.<ul>
<li>Whale flipper, Human hand, Bat wing.</li>
<li>They all have 1 bone -&gt; 2 bones -&gt; little bones format.</li>
<li>Proof they are related.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lamarck vs Darwin</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Lamarck</strong> (Wrong): "The giraffe stretched its neck, so its baby had a long neck." (Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics).</li>
<li><strong>Darwin</strong> (Right): "Giraffes with slightly longer necks survived better and had more babies. Short neck giraffes died."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>"Theory"</strong>: Remember, in science, a Theory is a massive explanation supported by facts (Gravity, Cell Theory, Evolution). It is not a hunch.</li>
</ul>
