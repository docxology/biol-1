<h1>Module 15: Darwin and Evolution</h1>
<h2>Comprehension &amp; Critical Thinking Questions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Understanding Core Concepts</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Darwin's Big Idea</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Define <strong>Natural Selection</strong>.</li>
<li>What is "Descent with Modification"?</li>
<li>Does an <em>individual</em> evolve, or does a <em>population</em> evolve?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Natural selection isn't magic; it requires specific conditions. Explain why <strong>Heritable Variation</strong>, <strong>Competition/Overproduction</strong>, and <strong>Differential Survival</strong> are necessary for evolution to occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In evolutionary biology, "Survival of the Fittest" doesn't mean the strongest. What does <strong>Fitness</strong> actually mean? (Hint: Offspring).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Applying Biological Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Evidence: Anatomy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiate between <strong>Homologous Structures</strong> (e.g., human arm vs bat wing) and <strong>Analogous Structures</strong> (e.g., bird wing vs insect wing). Which one suggests a common ancestor?</li>
<li>What is a <strong>Vestigial Structure</strong>? Give a human example (Appendix? Tailbone?).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evidence: Biochemical</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All life on Earth uses DNA and the same 20 amino acids. How is this strong evidence for a universal common ancestor?</li>
<li>If Human hemoglobin is more similar to Chimpanzee hemoglobin than to Dog hemoglobin, what does that imply about our evolutionary history?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Analyzing &amp; Evaluating</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mechanisms of Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A farmer sprays a pesticide on his corn. 99% of the bugs die. Next year, he sprays again, but only 50% die.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Did the bugs "learn" to survive? Did the pesticide cause mutations? Explain how <strong>Natural Selection</strong> created this resistant population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artificial Selection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Humans bred wolves into Chihuahuas and Great Danes. How is <strong>Artificial Selection</strong> similar to Natural Selection? How is it different?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
