Module 15: Darwin and Evolution
Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

Part 1: Core Concepts
Darwin's Theory
       Define natural selection.
       What is "descent with modification"?
       Does an individual evolve, or does a population evolve?

Requirements for Natural Selection
       Explain why heritable variation, competition, and differential survival are necessary for evolution.

Fitness
       In evolutionary biology, what does "fitness" mean? (Reproductive success)

Part 2: Application
Anatomical Evidence
       Differentiate homologous structures (common ancestry) from analogous structures (convergent evolution).
       What is a vestigial structure? Provide a human example.

Molecular Evidence
       All life uses DNA and the same genetic code. How does this support common ancestry?
       If human hemoglobin is more similar to chimpanzee hemoglobin than dog hemoglobin, what does this imply?

Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
Natural Selection in Action
       Scenario: A farmer sprays pesticide. 99% of insects die. Next year, only 50% die.
       Did the insects "learn" resistance? Explain using natural selection.

Artificial Selection
       Humans bred wolves into diverse dog breeds. How is artificial selection similar to and different from natural selection?
