<ol>
<li>
<p>What are the three main principles of cell theory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the cell considered the basic unit of life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who were some of the scientists that contributed to the development of cell theory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the main structural difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give two examples of organisms with prokaryotic cells and two examples with eukaryotic cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What structures do both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have in common?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the structure of the plasma membrane. Why is it called the "fluid mosaic model"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the function of the nucleus, and why is it called the "control center" of the cell?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the difference between rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the function of the Golgi apparatus in protein processing and transport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the primary function of mitochondria? Why are they called the "powerhouses" of the cell?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would happen to a cell if its lysosomes stopped functioning properly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trace the path of a secretory protein from synthesis to export out of the cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a cell were a factory, what role would each of these organelles play: nucleus, ribosome, ER, Golgi, mitochondria?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What three structures are found in plant cells but NOT in typical animal cells?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do plant cells have both mitochondria and chloroplasts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the endosymbiotic theory. What evidence supports this theory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the components of the cytoskeleton and their functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why must cells remain small? Explain the relationship between surface area and volume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do cilia and flagella differ in structure and function?</p>
