Module 4: Cells — Keys to Success

Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

State the three principles of cell theory
Differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
Identify major organelles and describe their functions
Trace protein production through the endomembrane system
Explain the endosymbiotic theory and its evidence
Compare plant and animal cells

Key Terms to Know

Cell Theory — All living things are made of cells; cells are the basic unit of life; cells come from pre-existing cells
Prokaryotic Cell — Simple cell lacking membrane-bound nucleus and organelles (bacteria, archaea)
Eukaryotic Cell — Complex cell with membrane-bound nucleus and organelles
Nucleus — Contains DNA; controls cell activities ("control center")
Ribosome — Site of protein synthesis
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) — Rough ER: protein synthesis; Smooth ER: lipid synthesis
Golgi Apparatus — Modifies, packages, and ships proteins
Mitochondria — Cellular respiration; produces ATP ("powerhouse")
Chloroplast — Photosynthesis; found only in plant cells
Lysosome — Digestion and waste removal
Central Vacuole — Storage and support in plant cells
Cell Wall — Rigid outer layer in plant cells
Cytoskeleton — Protein fibers providing structure and movement
Plasma Membrane — Phospholipid bilayer boundary of the cell

Study Tips

Draw and label diagrams of plant and animal cells
Use the factory analogy — Match each organelle to a factory department
Create a comparison table — Prokaryote vs. Eukaryote, Plant vs. Animal
Trace the protein pathway — Ribosome → Rough ER → Golgi → Vesicle → Membrane
List endosymbiotic evidence — Double membrane, own DNA, own ribosomes, self-replication
