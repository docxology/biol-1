Module 12: Gene Expression (DNA to Protein)

Describe the double helix. What forms the backbone? What forms the rungs?

Explain antiparallel orientation (5′ to 3′).

State Chargaff's Rules. If a DNA sample is 20% Adenine, what percent is Cytosine?

Diagram the flow: DNA → RNA → Protein.

Where does transcription occur? Where does translation occur?

What is the role of DNA polymerase? RNA polymerase? Ribosomes?

DNA replication is semi-conservative. Explain what this means.

Why is there a leading strand (continuous synthesis) and a lagging strand (Okazaki fragments)?

DNA template strand: 3′-TAC GGG AAA ACT-5′.

Transcribe to mRNA (5′→3′).

Translate to amino acids using a codon chart.

Explain the purpose of:

Introns vs. Exons

5′ Cap and Poly-A Tail

Why might alternative splicing be advantageous?

The genetic code is nearly universal. How does this support common ancestry? How does it enable biotechnology (e.g., producing human insulin in bacteria)?
