Module 2: Basic Chemistry — Keys to Success

Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Describe atomic structure and subatomic particles
Explain how atoms form bonds (ionic, covalent, hydrogen)
Distinguish between polar and non-polar molecules
Explain water's properties and their importance for life
Use the pH scale and explain buffers

Key Terms to Know

Atom — Smallest unit of matter retaining element properties
Proton — Positive charge, in nucleus, determines atomic number
Neutron — No charge, in nucleus, determines isotope
Electron — Negative charge, orbits nucleus, determines bonding
Ionic Bond — Transfer of electrons between atoms
Covalent Bond — Sharing of electrons between atoms
Polar Molecule — Unequal sharing of electrons (e.g., water)
Hydrogen Bond — Weak attraction between H and electronegative atoms
Cohesion — Water molecules sticking to each other
Adhesion — Water sticking to other surfaces
Specific Heat — Energy to raise temperature; water's is high
Solvent — Substance that dissolves others; water is universal solvent
pH Scale — Measures acidity/alkalinity (0-14)
Buffer — Substance that resists pH changes

Study Tips

Remember COHN — Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen are the four most common elements in living things
Draw water molecules — Show hydrogen bonds between them
Use the pH scale — 7 is neutral, <7 is acidic, >7 is basic
Know that pH is logarithmic — Each number is 10× change
