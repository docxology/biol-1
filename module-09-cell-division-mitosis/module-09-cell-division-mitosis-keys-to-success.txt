Module 9: Cell Division and Mitosis
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Sequence the phases of the eukaryotic cell cycle and mitosis.
Differentiate between chromatin, chromosomes, and sister chromatids.
Compare cytokinesis in plant and animal cells.
Explain the genetic basis of cancer (oncogenes vs. tumor suppressors).

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Somatic Cell: Any body cell (diploid, 2n).
[ ] Gamete: A reproductive cell (haploid, n).
[ ] Sister Chromatids: Identical copies of a replicated chromosome, joined at the centromere.
[ ] Centromere: The region where sister chromatids are attached.
[ ] Metastasis: The spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to other body sites.
[ ] Genome: The complete set of genetic information in an organism.

Concept Check
The Cell Cycle
   Question: Which phase occupies the majority of the cell cycle?
   Key Answer: Interphase (G₁, S, G₂) comprises approximately 90% of the cycle. Mitosis and cytokinesis are relatively brief.

Tumor Suppressors
   Question: What is the role of p53?
   Key Answer: p53 is a tumor suppressor that monitors DNA integrity. If DNA damage is detected, p53 halts the cell cycle for repair or triggers apoptosis. Mutations in p53 are found in over 50% of human cancers.

Oncogenes
   Question: What types of genes are implicated in cancer?
   Key Answer:
       Proto-oncogenes: Normal genes that promote cell division. Mutations convert them to oncogenes (constitutively active).
       Tumor Suppressors: Genes that inhibit division. Loss-of-function mutations lead to uncontrolled proliferation.

Prokaryotic Division
   Question: How do prokaryotes replicate?
   Key Answer: Binary fission—the circular chromosome replicates, and the cell divides into two identical daughter cells. This is simpler and faster than mitotic division.
