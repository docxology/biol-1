Compare the three domains of life

Key Terms to Know

Biology — The study of life
Cell — The basic unit of life
Homeostasis — Maintaining internal balance
Metabolism — All chemical reactions in an organism
Taxonomy — The science of classifying organisms
Binomial Nomenclature — Two-name scientific naming system (Genus species)
Hypothesis — Testable explanation for an observation
Theory — Well-supported explanation based on repeated testing
Scientific Law — Description of a consistent pattern in nature
Independent Variable — What the experimenter changes
Dependent Variable — What is measured in response
Control Group — The group not receiving treatment
Autotroph — Makes its own food (producers)
Heterotroph — Consumes other organisms (consumers)

Study Tips

Memorize the levels of organization — Atom, molecule, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, organ system, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere
Use a mnemonic for taxonomy — Dear King Philip Came Over For Good Soup (Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species)
Practice designing experiments — Identify variables and controls
Know the characteristics of life — Growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, energy use, homeostasis, cells, adaptation
