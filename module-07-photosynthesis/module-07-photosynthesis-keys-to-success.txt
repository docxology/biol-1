Module 7: Photosynthesis — Keys to Success

Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Write and explain the photosynthesis equation
Describe chloroplast structure
Compare light-dependent and light-independent reactions
Trace electron flow through photosystems
Explain adaptations in C₄ and CAM plants

Key Terms to Know

Photosynthesis — Converting light energy to chemical energy (glucose)
Chloroplast — Organelle where photosynthesis occurs
Thylakoid — Membrane sacs inside chloroplast
Granum — Stack of thylakoids
Stroma — Fluid surrounding thylakoids
Chlorophyll — Green pigment that absorbs light
Light-Dependent Reactions — In thylakoid; produce ATP and NADPH
Calvin Cycle — In stroma; uses ATP and NADPH to make G3P
Photosystem I and II — Protein complexes that capture light
RuBisCO — Enzyme that fixes CO₂ in Calvin Cycle
C₄ Plants — Separate carbon fixation spatially (corn, sugarcane)
CAM Plants — Separate carbon fixation temporally (cacti, succulents)

Photosynthesis Equation

6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Key Comparisons

| Stage | Location | Input | Output |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| Light Reactions | Thylakoid | H₂O, light | ATP, NADPH, O₂ |
| Calvin Cycle | Stroma | CO₂, ATP, NADPH | G3P (sugar) |

Study Tips

Know the equation — CO₂ + H₂O + light → glucose + O₂
Trace electron flow — Water → PSII → PSI → NADPH
Understand chemiosmosis — H⁺ gradient drives ATP synthesis
Compare C₃, C₄, CAM — How each handles hot/dry conditions
