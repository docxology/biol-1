Module 10: Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction
Keys to Success & Study Guide

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Contrast the outcomes of asexual and sexual reproduction.
Distinguish between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids.
Diagram the phases of Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
Explain the three sources of genetic variation: crossing over, independent assortment, and random fertilization.

Key Terminology Checklist
Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.

[ ] Allele: An alternative form of a gene at a specific locus.
[ ] Karyotype: A display of an individual's chromosomes arranged by size and banding pattern.
[ ] Synapsis: The pairing of homologous chromosomes during Prophase I.
[ ] Tetrad (Bivalent): The structure formed by two synapsed homologous chromosomes (four chromatids).
[ ] Euploidy: Having the correct number of chromosomes.
[ ] Aneuploidy: An abnormal chromosome number (e.g., trisomy, monosomy).

Concept Check
Meiosis I vs. Meiosis II
   Question: What separates in Meiosis I? In Meiosis II?
   Key Answer:
       Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate (reductional division: 2n → n).
       Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate (equational division: n → n).

Genetic Variation
   Question: Why is genetic variation important?
   Key Answer: Variation provides raw material for natural selection. Genetically diverse populations are more resilient to environmental change and disease.

Human Chromosomes
   Question: How many chromosomes do humans have?
   Key Answer: 46 total (23 pairs): 22 pairs of autosomes + 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY). Gametes contain 23 chromosomes.

Nondisjunction
   Question: What is nondisjunction?
   Key Answer: The failure of chromosomes or chromatids to separate properly during cell division, resulting in aneuploid gametes.
