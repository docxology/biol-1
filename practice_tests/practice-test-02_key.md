## Part C: Short Answer Key

**36. Photosynthesis vs. Cellular Respiration:**

- Photosynthesis: CO2 + H2O + light → glucose + O2 (builds glucose)
- Cellular Respiration: glucose + O2 → CO2 + H2O + ATP (breaks down glucose)

**37. Mitosis vs. Meiosis:**

- Mitosis: 2 identical diploid cells; for growth and repair
- Meiosis: 4 unique haploid cells; for sexual reproduction

**38. Central Dogma:**

- DNA → RNA → Protein
- Information flows from DNA (replication) to RNA (transcription) to protein (translation)

**39. Evidence for Evolution (any one):**

- Fossil record, homologous structures, embryological similarities, molecular/DNA evidence, direct observation (bacteria, finches)

**40. Natural Selection:**

- Individuals with favorable traits survive and reproduce more; these traits become more common in the population over generations, leading to adaptation
