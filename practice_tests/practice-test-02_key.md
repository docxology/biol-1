## Part C: Short Answer Key

**36. Passive vs. Active Transport:**

- Passive transport: does not require energy (ATP); moves with concentration gradient (ex: diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion)
- Active transport: requires energy (ATP); moves against concentration gradient (ex: sodium-potassium pump)

**37. Cell in Hypertonic Solution:**

- Water moves OUT of the cell (toward higher solute concentration)
- Animal cell: will shrink (crenation)
- Plant cell: will plasmolyze (cell membrane pulls away from cell wall), but cell wall prevents complete collapse

**38. Light Reactions vs. Calvin Cycle:**

- Light reactions: occur in thylakoid membranes; produce ATP, NADPH, and O₂
- Calvin cycle: occurs in stroma; uses ATP and NADPH to produce glucose (G3P)

**39. Photosynthesis vs. Cellular Respiration:**

- Photosynthesis: CO₂ + H₂O + light → glucose + O₂ (builds glucose, stores energy)
- Cellular Respiration: glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + ATP (breaks down glucose, releases energy)
- They are essentially opposite processes

**40. Why We Breathe:**

- We inhale oxygen because it is required as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain
- Without oxygen, the ETC cannot function and very little ATP can be produced
- We exhale CO₂ because it is a waste product released when pyruvate is broken down in the Krebs cycle
