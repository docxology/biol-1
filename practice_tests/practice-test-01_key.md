## Part C: Short Answer Key

**36. Characteristics of living things (any 3):**

- Cellular organization (made of cells)
- Metabolism (use energy, carry out chemical reactions)
- Homeostasis (maintain internal stability)
- Growth and development
- Reproduction
- Response to stimuli
- Adaptation/evolution

**37. Ionic vs. Covalent bonds:**

- Ionic bonds: electrons are transferred from one atom to another, creating ions
- Covalent bonds: electrons are shared between atoms

**38. Four macromolecules:**

- Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, Nucleic Acids
- Protein monomer: amino acid

**39. Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:**

- Prokaryotes: no nucleus or membrane-bound organelles (ex: bacteria)
- Eukaryotes: have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (ex: plants, animals, fungi)
