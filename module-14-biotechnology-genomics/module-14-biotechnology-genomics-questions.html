<li>
<p>What is a restriction enzyme? How do "sticky ends" facilitate ligation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a vector (e.g., plasmid)? How is it used to introduce foreign DNA into bacteria?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the three steps of PCR: Denaturation, Annealing, Extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is PCR called "molecular photocopying"? Why is it useful for forensics?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain how gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do smaller fragments migrate faster or slower? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define transgenic organism (GMO).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outline the steps to produce insulin-secreting bacteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a paternity test, a child has bands at positions A and B. The mother has band A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must the biological father have band B? Explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiate ex vivo (cells treated outside the body) and in vivo (treatment inside the body) gene therapy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the major challenges? (Delivery, immune response, targeting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have sequenced the human genome. Why doesn't knowing the sequence immediately reveal gene function?</p>
