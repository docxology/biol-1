## Manuscript Construction Method

Use the manuscript to describe source-of-truth directories, publish pipeline boundaries, and verification responsibilities without exposing private course content beyond what the repo already authorizes.

## Evidence Promotion

Future manuscript claims should be promoted in this order:

1. Identify the source file, test, generated artifact, or external reference.
2. Add or verify the project-local gate that reproduces the claim.
3. Move volatile values into generated manuscript variables when they can change across runs.
4. Add prose only after the supporting evidence path is stable.

## Template Compliance

Each section file has one H1 label, no unresolved citations, and no generated-value tokens until a project-local token producer exists.
