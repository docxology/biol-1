<h1>Module 11: Mendelian Genetics</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define the Law of Segregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the Law of Independent Assortment. Does the inheritance of one trait affect another?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the difference between homozygous dominant (AA), heterozygous (Aa), and homozygous recessive (aa).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If "A" = Tall and "a" = Short, what is the phenotype of "Aa"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiate between incomplete dominance and codominance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain polygenic inheritance using human height or skin color as an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In peas, Purple flowers (P) are dominant to White flowers (p).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform a cross: Pp × Pp. What are the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human blood type involves multiple alleles (Iᴬ, Iᴮ, i) and codominance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can a Type A mother and Type B father have a Type O child? Show the Punnett square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two unaffected parents have an affected child. Is the trait likely dominant or recessive?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hydrangea flower color changes with soil pH. Does genotype always strictly determine phenotype? How does the environment modify gene expression?</p>
